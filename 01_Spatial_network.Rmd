# Spatial scaffolding for the simulations
  Using the ~8000 currently extant cultures cataloged in the glottolog repository
(http://glottolog.org), we calculated a symetrical spatial proximity network 
connecting them. This network provides the scaffolding for the simulation to 
grow on. 

```{r}
library(FARM)
library(spdep)
library(geosphere)
library(maps)
```

  We constructed this network using the functions knearneigh() and knn2nb() in 
the package spdep. The user identifies the number of neighbors and the 
algorythm identifies that many nearest neighbors calculated based on proximity.
Using those neighbor identifiers, we then calculated the great circle distance
between each point using the gcIntermediate() function from the geosphere 
package and ploted those lines over a map. 

  Through a seperate analysis based on ecological niche models of agricultue, 
we determined that networks with 7 neighbors produced spatial distributions with 
the lowest level of autocorrelation. Accordingly, we ran the simulation on 
networks with 5-9 connections between neighbors to represent some variation in 
this parameter but centered these estimates around 7. At the begining of each 
simualation, one network was chosen from the 5 possible arrangements and used
as simulation scaffolding. The number of neighbors assigned to a particular 
simulation replicate is recorded in the metadata so it can be extracted and used 
as a covariate in later models. 

  Here is the code for producing and plotting these networks. The object 
language_centroids is in the FARM package, so make sure that package is loaded
so R can find the required data. Below the code are plots of the 5 possible 
graph arrangements used in the FARM simulations. 

```{r eval=FALSE}


coords <- as.matrix(apply(language_centroids[, 3:4], 2, as.numeric)) #coords
conds <- ifelse(suitability2 == 0, 1, 2)
conds[is.na(conds)] <- sample(c(1, 2), sum(is.na(conds)), replace = TRUE) 
origins <- language_centroids[, 5]



nbs_number <- 2
this_row <- 1
number_of_neighbors <- 7

number_of_neighbors <- i
nbs <- knearneigh(coords, k = number_of_neighbors, longlat = TRUE)
