abstract = {In the Waikato Region of New Zealand, Pinus radiata (D. Don) plantations are becoming increasingly common on land adjacent to native forest fragments. It is unclear whether this juxtaposition is beneficial or detrimental to native forest fragment quality and persistence. We hypothesized that adjacent dense plantations buffer native fragments from microclimatic exposure, reducing edge effects and expanding the area of interior-like native forest. Microclimate parameters were measured in native forest fragments adjacent to grazed pasture ('abrupt' edges) and in fragments adjacent to mature P. radiata plantations ('embedded' edges) during late summer. Photosynthetically active radiation, air temperature and vapour pressure deficit (VPD) were measured along transects perpendicular to edges during the mid-afternoon, when gradients were typically steady and maximal, to investigate spatial variation. At paired abrupt versus embedded edges these same variables were monitored for week-long periods to determine temporal variation. In fragments adjacent to pasture, conditions were significantly lighter and warmer (but not drier) than the interior along transects at distances up to 20 m from the edge. In contrast, no variables differed significantly along transects adjacent to pine. The different microclimate variables measured at edges (except VPD) contributed to edge effects at different times through a daily cycle. Photosynthetically active radiation was significantly different between abrupt and embedded edges at all times of the day. Air temperature was significantly different during mid-day and afternoon, but not during the morning nor at night. Vapour pressure deficit varied considerably over time and between sites, but was never consistently higher at one type of edge. We conclude that pine plantations in the Waikato Region provide valuable microclimate buffering during the day, principally due to their effect in reducing light and temperature to interior-like conditions at native forest edges. Consequently, plantations are a compatible neighbouring land use to forest fragments. Such buffering could be extended through the pine harvesting-replanting phase with appropriate management, such as leaving an undisturbed margin during harvest.},

abstract = {Anthropogenic fragmentation of landscapes is known as a major reason for the loss of species in industrialized countries. Landscape fragmentation caused by roads, railway lines, extension of settlement areas, etc., further enhances the dispersion of pollutants and acoustic emissions and affects local climatic conditions, water balance, scenery, and land use. In this study, three new measures of fragmentation are introduced: degree of landscape division (D), splitting index (S), and effective mesh size (m). They characterize the anthropogenic penetration of landscapes from a geometric point of view and are calculated from the distribution function of the remaining patch sizes. First, D, S, and m are defined, their mathematical properties are discussed, and their reactions to the six fragmentation phases of perforation, incision, dissection, dissipation, shrinkage, and attrition are analysed. Then they are compared with five other known fragmentation indices with respect to nine suitability criteria such as intuitive interpretation, low sensivity to very small patches, monotonous reaction to different fragmentation phases, and detection of structural differences. Their ability to distinguish spatial patterns is illustrated by means of two series of model patterns. In particular, the effective mesh size (m), representing an intensive and area-proportionately additive measure, proves to be well suited for comparing the fragmentation of regions with differing total size.},

abstract = {Animal distribution patterns in human-modified landscapes are often examined from the basis of the "fragmentation model", which recognises habitat patches located within an inhospitable matrix. The fragmentation model can establish correlations between landscape pattern and animal distribution patterns. However, it is limited in its ability to generate a process-based understanding of species distribution patterns. Here we propose a process-based conceptual landscape model. The "continuum model" is derived from continuum theory, and recognises the importance of space-related ecological variables alongside other factors, such as the availability of suitable food, shelter, and climatic conditions. The continuum model allows for gradual changes in these variables through space, and assumes species respond individualistically to their environment. We contrast the continuum model with the fragmentation model, and outline how it can be used to interpret and design empirical studies. While the fragmentation model may provide a satisfactory description of ecological patterns where many species are confined to human-defined "patches", the continuum model can help to establish links between fundamental ecological processes and individualistic species distribution patterns. Conservation guidelines arising from the fragmentation model will emphasise the importance of large and well-connected pre-defined "habitat" patches. Conversely, the continuum model recognises potentially large discrepancies between different species' ecological requirements. Conservation guidelines arising from the continuum model therefore will focus on habitat heterogeneity at multiple spatial scales to enhance the number of niches available to different species.},

abstract = {1. The hypothesis that habitat fragmentation (biotic or abiotic) alters the transmission of disease within a population is explored using field data from a well-studied amphibian-pathogen system. 2. We used the Ambystoma tigrinum-A. tigrinum virus (ATV) model system to show how habitat fragmentation as a result of emergent vegetation and habitat management affects disease transmission dynamics in ponds across a landscape. 3. We quantified variation in ATV infection over time and across the landscape. ATV infection was significantly higher in ponds modified for livestock use (P = 0.032). Disease incidence decreased with increased amounts of emergent vegetation (P {\textless} 0.001). These factors appear to control disease transmission by altering the host contact rate and with it disease transmission. 4. A field experiment to test the effect of emergent vegetation on the distribution of larvae in ponds demonstrated a behavioural change in larvae found in sparsely vegetated ponds. Microhabitat choices resulted in larvae being concentrated at the pond edge resulting in a 'halo effect' in sparsely vegetated ponds, whereas larvae in heavily vegetated ponds were distributed more evenly throughout. Microhabitat choice affects the effective density that larvae experience. This 'halo effect' increases contact rates in the shallows of sparsely vegetated ponds and increases the transmission of a directly transmitted pathogen. 5. Despite recurrent epidemics of a lethal Ranavirus in tiger salamanders on the Kaibab Plateau, Arizona, USA, these populations persist. We discuss the implications of our results in the context of density-dependent transmission and homogeneous mixing, two increases key assumptions of epidemiological theory.},

abstract = {Theoretical models predict that the relative importance of facilitation and competition may vary inversely across gradients of abiotic stress. However, these predictions have not been thoroughly tested in the field, especially in semi-arid environments. In this study, we evaluated how the net effect of the tussock grass Stipa tenacissima on the shrub Pistacia lentiscus varied across a gradient of abiotic stress in semi-arid Mediterranean steppes. We fitted the relationship between accumulated rainfall and the relative neighbour index (our measures of abiotic stress and of the net effect of S. tenacissima on P. lentiscus, respectively), which varied across this gradient, to a quadratic model. Competitive interactions dominated at both extremes of the gradient. Our results do not support established theory. Instead, they suggest that a shift from facilitation to competition under high abiotic stress conditions is likely to occur when the levels of the most limiting resource are so low that the benefits provided by the facilitator cannot overcome its own resource uptake.},

The major challenge for present day plant populations is how to adapt and cope with altered abiotic and biotic environments caused by climate change, when at the same time adaptive and evolutionary potential is decreased as habitat fragmentation reduces genetic variation and increases inbreeding. Although the ecological and evolutionary effects of fragmentation and climate change have been investigated separately, their combined effects remained largely unexplored. In this review, we will discuss the individual and joint effects of habitat fragmentation and climate change on plants and how the abilities and ways in which plants can respond and cope with climate change may be compromised due to habitat fragmentation.},

abstract = {Human landscape modification has led to habitat fragmentation for many species. Habitat fragmentation, leading to isolation, decrease in patch size and increased edge effect, is observed in fen ecosystems that comprise many endangered plant species. However, until now it has remained unclear whether habitat fragmentation per se has a significant additional negative effect on plant species persistence, besides habitat loss and degradation. We investigated the relative effect of isolation, habitat size, and habitat edge compared to the effect of habitat degradation by including both 'fragmentation variables' and abiotic variables in best subsets logistic regression analyses for six fen-plant species. For all but one species, besides abiotic variables one or more variables related to fragmentation were included in the regression model. For Carex lasiocarpa, isolation was the most important factor limiting species distribution, while for Juncus subnodulosus and Menyanthes trifoliata, isolation was the second most important factor. The effect of habitat size differed among species and an increasing edge had a negative effect on the occurrence of Carex lasiocarpa and Pedicularis palustris. Our results clearly show that even if abiotic conditions are suitable for certain species, isolation of habitat patches and an increased habitat edge caused by habitat fragmentation affect negatively the viability of characteristic fen plant species. Therefore, it is important not only to improve habitat quality but also to consider spatial characteristics of the habitat of target species when deciding on plant conservation strategies in intensively used landscapes, such as fen areas in Western Europe and North America. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

Although scale dependency of the relationship between energy availability and species richness (the species-energy relationship) has been documented, the exact relationship between the species-area and the species-energy relationship has not been studied explicitly. Here we show, using two extensive data sets on avian distributions in different biogeographic regions, that there is a negative interaction between energy availability and area in their effect on species richness. The slope of the species-area relationship is lower in areas with higher levels of available energy, and the slope of the species-energy relationship is lower for larger areas. This three-dimensional species-area-energy relationship can be understood in terms of probabilistic processes affecting the proportions of sites occupied by individual species. According to this theory, high environmental energy elevates species' occupancies, which depress the slope of the species-area curve.},

abstract = {During COP15, Parties agreed that reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation and enhancing "removals of greenhouse gas emission by forests" (REDD plus) in developing countries through positive incentives under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was capable of dealing with global emissions. As REDD plus seeks to lower emission from stopping deforestation and forest degradation, ecosystem-based benefits also could be part of these efforts and significant opportunities for those benefits such as slowing habitat fragmentation, conservation of forest biodiversity, soil conservation, and water regulation may flow from the scheme of REDD plus. Our study aims to model carbon stock changes and forest fragmentation for REDD plus. Here we try to 'piggyback' forest fragmentation onto the scheme that will be required to measure forest carbon stock and emission reduction. The result shows that carbon stocks in study area experienced a dramatic reduction. In addition to such marked changes in carbon dynamics, forest delivered strong synergies in fragmentation and water erosion. As such mechanism to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, plus conservation of forest carbon stocks, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks are likely to present opportunities for multi benefits that fall outside the scope of carbon stocks. ?? 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Recent vegetation dynamics in the northern and western Mediterranean region are mainly the result of socio-economical changes. Old-field succession and the cessation of extensive grazing have enhanced reforestation. However, vegetation recovery after disturbance can be impaired in arid environments. Here we analysed recent vegetation dynamics (1957-98) in a northern, semi-arid area of the Mediterranean region: the Middle Ebro Valley. Centuries of timber harvesting, cropping and grazing in this region have produced a highly fragmented landscape. Recently, socio-economic changes have led to intensified use of productive areas. Traditional land use in marginal areas has been abandoned. In this study, we examined the main factors related to vegetation recovery in a fragmented, semi-arid landscape. We used aerial photographs from 1957 and 1998 to produce vegetation maps. A transition matrix showed that vegetation recovery was very scarce. Generalized additive models (GAM) and generalized linear models (GLM) were used to study the relationships between vegetation dynamics, fragmentation, water availability, present land use and land use changes in the area. We found a strong negative relationship between distance from seed or propagule source and vegetation recovery. This indicates that fragmentation contributes to limiting recovery. In addition, we observed that aridity limited vegetation recovery. However, current land use and topography showed weaker relationships with vegetation recovery than those reported in other Mediterranean and semi-arid landscapes. We conclude that fragmentation and aridity are the main determinants of vegetation recovery in the Middle Ebro Valley, while current land use plays a secondary role. ?? 2006 Gesellschaft f??r ??kologie.},

abstract = {Many studies have demonstrated that forest fragmentation reduces populations of animal species and causes local extinction, triggering many cascading effects. The effect of fragmentation on animals can be exerted through various processes, but such effects have been understudied. In this study, we posed the possibility of differences in the seasonal effects of fragmentation on frugivorous birds and their dispersal of seeds belonging to five tree species. We hypothesized that these effects may be caused by birds and their habitat selection for suitable breeding forests. We compared the abundance and species richness of frugivorous birds and the number of bird-removed fruits between a well-preserved and a fragmented temperate forest for two consecutive years. The abundance of birds was lower in the fragmented compared to the well-preserved forest during the breeding season, although no clear differences in species richness were observed. In contrast, similar decreases in bird abundance were not observed during the migratory season. After controlling for variation in crop size, the number of bird-removed fruits was lower in the fragmented forest compared to the well-preserved forest during the breeding season, but there was no such tendency during the migratory season. These results indicate that evaluations regarding the effects of fragmentation on seed dispersal that do not consider seasonal factors may lead to erroneous conclusions. This study suggests that the effects of fragmentation can be exerted though various processes, many of which remain poorly studied and warrant further examination.},

abstract = {Floodplain-river ecosystems are natural fragmented systems because of periodic hydrological connections. The integrity of these ecosystems is thought to be dependent, in part, upon exchanges of energy and matter between patches, such as the main river channel, adjacent floodplain surface and other morphological features, during periods of connection. Flow regulation and its associated infrastructure change the natural character of fragmentation in floodplain-river ecosystems, and have important consequences for their overall productivity. This paper considers the influence of water resources development on the character of fragmentation in a large lowland river in SE Australia. Large-scale water resources development in the Macintyre River, Australia, has significantly altered the spatial and temporal patterns of hydrological connections. The construction of weirs and other embankments on the lower Macintyre River floodplain prevents water movement through a series of anabranch channels thereby reducing the availability of these floodplain patches by 55{\%}. In addition, because of flow regulation, hydrological connections to these channels occur up to 22{\%} less often. Data are presented showing the impacts of these changes on the potential supply of dissolved organic carbon from the anabranch channels during periods of inundation over a 98-year period. Reductions of up to 98{\%} of potential dissolved organic carbon supply from some anabranch channels were noted. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Habitat fragmentation implies a loss of habitat, reduced patch size and an increasing distance between patches, but also an increase of new habitat. Simulations of patterns and geometry of landscapes with decreasing proportion of the suitable habitat give rise to the prediction that the effect of habitat fragmentation on e.g. population size of a species would be primarily through habitat loss in landscape with a high proportion of suitable habitat. However, as the proportion of suitable habitat decreases in the landscape, area and isolation effects start influencing the population size of the species. Hence, the relative importance of pure habitat loss, patch size and isolation are expected to differ at different degrees of habitat fragmentation. This conclusion was supported by a review of studies on birds and mammals in habitat patches in landscapes with different proportions of suitable habitat: the random sample hypothesis was a good predictor of the effects of habitat fragmentation in landscapes with more than 30{\%} of suitable habitat. In these landscapes, habitat fragmentation is primarily habitat loss. However, in landscapes with highly fragmented habitat, patch size and isolation will complement the effect of habitat loss and the loss of species or decline in population size will be greater than expected from habitat loss alone. Habitat patches are parts of the landscape mosaic and the presence of a species in a patch may be a function not only of patch size and isolation, but also of the neighbouring habitat Habitat generalists may survive in very small patches because they can also utilize resources in the surroundings. Furthermore, the total species diversity across habitats in a given landscape may increase when new patches of habitat are created within the continuous habitat, since new species may be found in these new habitats, even if they are human-made.},

abstract = {The physiological mechanisms limiting and adjusting cold and heat tolerance have regained interest in the light of global warming and associated shifts in the geographical distribution of ectothermic animals. Recent comparative studies, largely carried out on marine ectotherms, indicate that the processes and limits of thermal tolerance are linked with the adjustment of aerobic scope and capacity of the whole animal as a crucial step in thermal adaptation on top of parallel adjustments at the molecular or membrane level. In accordance with Shelford's law of tolerance decreasing whole animal aerobic scope characterises the onset of thermal limitation at low and high pejus thresholds (pejus = getting worse). The drop in aerobic scope of an animal indicated by falling oxygen levels in the body fluids and or the progressively limited capacity of circulatory and ventilatory mechanisms. At high temperatures, excessive oxygen demand causes insufficient oxygen levels in the body fluids, whereas at low temperatures the aerobic capacity of mitochondria may become limiting for ventilation and circulation. Further cooling or warming beyond these limits leads to low or high critical threshold temperatures (Tc) where aerobic scope disappears and transition to an anaerobic mode of mitochondrial metabolism and progressive insufficiency of cellular energy levels occurs. The adjustments of mitochondrial densities and their functional properties appear as a critical process in defining and shifting thermal tolerance windows. The finding of an oxygen limited thermal tolerance owing to loss of aerobic scope is in line with Taylor's and Weibel's concept of symmorphosis, which implies that excess capacity of any component of the oxygen delivery system is avoided. The present study suggests that the capacity of oxygen delivery is set to a level just sufficient to meet maximum oxygen demand between the average highs and lows of environmental temperatures. At more extreme temperatures only time limited passive survival is supported by anaerobic metabolism or the protection of molecular functions by heat shock proteins and antioxidative defence. As a corollary, the first line of thermal sensitivity is due to capacity limitations at a high level of organisational complexity, i.e. the integrated function of the oxygen delivery system, before individual, molecular or membrane functions become disturbed. These interpretations are in line with the more general consideration that, as a result of the high level of complexity of metazoan organisms compared with simple eukaryotes and then prokaryotes, thermal tolerance is reduced in metazoans. A similar sequence of sensitivities prevails within the metazoan organism, with the highest sensitivity at the organismic level and wider tolerance windows at lower levels of complexity. However, the situation is different in that loss in aerobic scope and progressive hypoxia at the organismic level define the onset of thermal limitation which then transfers to lower hierarchical levels and causes cellular and molecular disturbances. Oxygen limitation contributes to oxidative stress and, finally, denaturation or malfunction of molecular repair, e.g. during suspension of protein synthesis. The sequence of thermal tolerance limits turns into a hierarchy, ranging from systemic to cellular to molecular levels. {\textcopyright} 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Inc.},

abstract = {The concept of habitat fragmentation has become an important theme in conservation research, and it is often used as if fragmentation were a unitary phenomenon. However, the concept is ambiguous, and empirical studies demonstrate a wide variety of direct and indirect effects, sometimes with mutually opposing implications. The effects of fragmentation vary across organisms, habitat types, and geographic regions. Such a contrast between a schematic concept and multifaceted empirical reality is counterproductive. I analyzed the stabilization of the schematic view of fragmentation by the early 1980s, using a genealogical narrative as a methodological approach. The main assumptions behind the schematic view were: (1) fragments are comparable to oceanic islands; (2) habitats sur- rounding fragments are hostile to a majority of the organisms; and (3) natural pre-frag- mentation conditions were uniform. The stabilization loop of this view was supported by the reduction of empirical research to species–area curve fitting, which always produced expected results. I present a model of the dynamics of fragmentation research that shows the schematic, island-biogeographic view as an ‘‘intellectual attractor.'' Since the 1980s, the theoretical presuppositions of the schematic view have been challenged, and empirical research has become multifaceted. Fragments of a particular habitat type are viewed as elements in a heterogeneous landscape rather than ‘‘islands'' surrounded by a hostile ‘‘sea.'' However, the island metaphor is still used in conservation contexts in the shape of species– area curves. It is backed by a presupposition that human-influenced environments are essentially different from so-called ‘‘natural'' environments, but this is unfounded. My suggestion is that our perspective should be broadened still further so that habitat frag- mentation is viewed as a particular form of human-induced environmental degradation; I discuss both theoretical and practical implications of this suggestion.},

abstract = {Habitat loss has pervasive and disruptive impacts on biodiversity in habitat remnants. The magnitude of the ecological impacts of habitat loss can be exacerbated by the spatial arrangement -- or fragmentation -- of remaining habitat. Fragmentation per se is a landscape-level phenomenon in which species that survive in habitat remnants are confronted with a modified environment of reduced area, increased isolation and novel ecological boundaries. The implications of this for individual organisms are many and varied, because species with differing life history strategies are differentially affected by habitat fragmentation. Here, we review the extensive literature on species responses to habitat fragmentation, and detail the numerous ways in which confounding factors have either masked the detection, or prevented the manifestation, of predicted fragmentation effects. Large numbers of empirical studies continue to document changes in species richness with decreasing habitat area, with positive, negative and no relationships regularly reported. The debate surrounding such widely contrasting results is beginning to be resolved by findings that the expected positive species-area relationship can be masked by matrix-derived spatial subsidies of resources to fragment-dwelling species and by the invasion of matrix-dwelling species into habitat edges. Significant advances have been made recently in our understanding of how species interactions are altered at habitat edges as a result of these changes. Interestingly, changes in biotic and abiotic parameters at edges also make ecological processes more variable than in habitat interiors. Individuals are more likely to encounter habitat edges in fragments with convoluted shapes, leading to increased turnover and variability in population size than in fragments that are compact in shape. Habitat isolation in both space and time disrupts species distribution patterns, with consequent effects on metapopulation dynamics and the genetic structure of fragment-dwelling populations. Again, the matrix habitat is a strong determinant of fragmentation effects within remnants because of its role in regulating dispersal and dispersal-related mortality, the provision of spatial subsidies and the potential mediation of edge-related microclimatic gradients. We show that confounding factors can mask many fragmentation effects. For instance, there are multiple ways in which species traits like trophic level, dispersal ability and degree of habitat specialisation influence species-level responses. The temporal scale of investigation may have a strong influence on the results of a study, with short-term crowding effects eventually giving way to long-term extinction debts. Moreover, many fragmentation effects like changes in genetic, morphological or behavioural traits of species require time to appear. By contrast, synergistic interactions of fragmentation with climate change, human-altered disturbance regimes, species interactions and other drivers of population decline may magnify the impacts of fragmentation. To conclude, we emphasise that anthropogenic fragmentation is a recent phenomenon in evolutionary time and suggest that the final, long-term impacts of habitat fragmentation may not yet have shown themselves.},

abstract = {* Research addressing the effects of habitat fragmentation on species, assemblages or ecosystems has been fraught with difficulties, from its conceptual foundation to statistical analyses and interpretation. Yet, it is critical to address such challenges as ecosystems are rapidly being altered across the world. * Many studies have concluded that effects of habitat loss exceed those of fragmentation per se, that is, the degree to which a given amount of habitat is broken apart. There is also evidence from different biomes and taxa that habitat configuration, that is, the spatial arrangement of habitat at a given time, may influence several landscape processes such as functional connectivity, edge and matrix effects, and thus population viability. * Instead of focusing attention on the relative influence of either habitat loss or fragmentation, we must identify portions of the gradient in habitat amount where configuration effects are most likely to be observed. Here, we suggest that all species are, to a certain degree, sensitive to landscape change and that, assuming a homogeneous matrix, habitat configuration will have a higher influence on species at intermediate values of habitat amount, where configuration has potentially the greatest variability. * On the basis of empirical studies and simulations, we expect that species that are relatively tolerant to fragmentation of their habitat will exhibit a wider band where amount and configuration interact compared to species less tolerant to fragmentation. * Synthesis and applications. Reducing habitat loss should be a top priority for conservation planners. However, researchers should also investigate the indirect impacts of habitat loss on biodiversity through fragmentation effects. This research aims to identify windows of opportunity where habitat configuration can mitigate to some extent the effects of habitat loss, particularly through the maintenance of functional connectivity.},

abstract = {{\textless}abstract abstract-type="summary"{\textgreater} Recent efforts to characterize soil water properties in terms of porosity and particle-size distribution have turned to the possibility that a fractal representation of soil structure may be especially apt. In this paper, we develop a fully self-consistent fractal model of aggregate and pore-space properties for structured soils. The concept underlying the model is the representation of a soil as a fragmented fractal porous medium. This concept involves four essential components: the mathematical partitioning of a bulk soil volume into self-similar pore- and aggregate-size classes, each of which is identified with a successive fragmentation step; the definition of a uniform probability for incomplete fragmentation in each size class; the definition of fractal dimensions for both completely and incompletely fragmented porous media; and the definition of a domain of length scales across which fractal behavior occurs. Model results include a number of equations that can be tested experimentally: (i) a fractal dimension ≤3; (ii) a decrease in aggregate bulk density (or an increase in porosity) with increasing aggregate size; (iii) a power-law aggregate-size-distribution function; (iv) a water potential that scales as an integer power of a similarity ratio; (v) a power-law expression for the water-retention curve; and (vi) an expression for hydraulic conductivity in terms of the conductivities of single-size arrangements of fractures embedded in a regular fractal network. Future research should provide experimental data with which to evaluate these predictions in detail.},

abstract = {Forest fragmentation is a growing concern throughout the Northeastern United States where the primary cause of fragmentation is suburban development. However, the extent and rate of change to the forest landscape is not fully understood, particularly by local land use decision makers. As part of the NASA funded Northeast Regional Earth Science Applications Center (RESAC) at the University of Connecticut, research is being conducted to quantify forest fragmentation in four pilot watersheds distributed throughout the Northeast. The forest fragmentation index presented here is based on the results of a forest fragmentation model, developed by researchers from the US EPA and Department of the Interior, in which forest pixels are classified as belonging to one of six types: interior forest, edge forest, perforated forest, undetermined forest, transitional forest, and patch forest. For this research, the forest fragmentation model was modified for use with 30-meter Landsat derived land cover information. The forest fragmentation index calculates a forest continuity value from the results of the forest fragmentation model. This value is used in conjunction with the total proportion of forest for a given area (excluding water) to produce an index of forest fragmentation. Any specified area (watershed or town) can be quantified as having high or low amounts of forest, and the degree to which that forest is fragmented. Using time series land cover information, changes in the forest landscape can be compared over time. This paper presents the details of our model for calculating the forest fragmentation index as well as a case study of its application to a town in one of the study watersheds.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tropical forest species are among the most sensitive to changing climatic conditions, and the forest they inhabit helps to buffer their microclimate from the variable climatic conditions outside the forest. However, habitat fragmentation and edge effects exposes vegetation to outside microclimatic conditions, thereby reducing the ability of the forest to buffer climatic variation. In this paper, we ask what proportion of forest in a fragmented ecosystem is impacted by altered microclimate conditions driven by edge effects, and extrapolate these results to the whole Atlantic Forest biome, one of the most disturbed biodiversity hotspots. To address these questions, we collected above and below ground temperature for a full year using temperature sensors placed in forest fragments of different sizes, and at different distances from the forest edge.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nPRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In the Atlantic forests of Brazil, we found that the buffering effect of forests reduced maximum outside temperatures by one third or more at ground level within a forest, with the buffering effect being stronger below-ground than one metre above-ground. The temperature buffering effect of forests was, however, reduced near forest edges with the edge effect extending up to 20 m inside the forest. The heavily fragmented nature of the Brazilian Atlantic forest means that 12{\%} of the remaining biome experiences altered microclimate conditions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Our results add further information about the extent of edge effects in the Atlantic Forest, and we suggest that maintaining a low perimeter-to-area ratio may be a judicious method for minimizing the amount of forest area that experiences altered microclimatic conditions in this ecosystem.},

abstract = {Abiotic stress (e.g. drought, heat, hypoxia, heavy metal pollution) can strongly affect senescence and the degradation of chloroplast proteins. In general, such a stress causes an earlier or accelerated senescence. Amino acids deriving from protein catabolism may be redistributed within the plant via the phloem and serve as a basis for protein synthesis in other plant parts. Under certain conditions amino acids may accumulate to high levels in leaves. Besides the onset and the velocity of senescence, the sequence of events may be altered under abiotic stress. Chloroplasts are dismantled in an early phase of senescence, while other subcellular compartments (e.g. mitochondria) are still functional. Rubisco is the most abundant protein on earth and contributes up to 50 {\%} of the soluble proteins and up to 30 {\%} of total leaf nitrogen in leaves of C3 plants. Therefore, the degradation of Rubisco and the reutilization of the amino acids liberated are important for the nitrogen budget of plants. During natural senescence, often only the bands representing the intact large and small subunits (but no fragments) are visible on stained gels or immunoblots. However, under abiotic stress inducing a rapid net degradation of Rubisco fragments of the large subunit may become detectable on immunoblots. Site-specific antibodies are helpful tools to characterize the fragmentation. From such experiments it became evident that under certain conditions (e.g. oxidative stress in isolated chloroplasts) small peptides at the C-terminus were released, while under other conditions (e.g. in leaf segments under hypoxia in darkness) the first cut(s) might occur near the N-terminus.},

We studied the responses of beetles to these factors in a fragmented upland rainforest landscape in north-east Queensland, Australia. Beetles were sampled using flight interception traps from six replicate sites in rainforest interior, rainforest edge, small rainforest remnants and pasture, interspersed across about 600 km2. Beetles from 10 family/subfamily groups were sorted to species. There were three major findings. First, converting rainforest into pasture has a very strong negative effect on beetle diversity and species composition. Very few beetle species were present in pasture and none of the most abundant species was more abundant in pasture than rainforest. Second, beetle assemblages appeared to respond to climate. Beetle species composition in drier rainforest habitats was different from that of moister rainforest and there were species unique to each rainforest type. Third, beetle species composition differed between small remnants and interior rainforest: drier-associated species were more abundant in small remnants, whereas wetter-associated species were more abundant in interiors. Edges tended to be intermediate. We argue that this pattern can be attributed to a fragmentation effect mediated by differences in microclimate rather than by floristic, structural, or area and isolation effects.},

Our results show that habitat fragmentation decreases the amplitude of the predator-prey population cycles while average population density is not as strongly affected in general. Beyond these simple trends however, the four models show differing responses to fragmentation, indicating that when making predictions about population survival and persistence in the face of habitat fragmentation, the choice of model is important.

abstract = {Hypotheses concerning community-level vulnerability to invasion often emphasize biotic interactions but fail to consider fine-scale variation in the physical environment. In this study, the interplay between interspecific competition and abiotic factors is examined with respect to whether scrub habitats in southern California become invaded by the Argentine ant (Linepithema humile). Argentine ants penetrate further into and attain higher abundances in mesic scrub fragments than they do in xeric scrub fragments. Probably as a result, native ant richness is lower in small ({\textless}30 ha), mesic fragments than in either small, xeric fragments or in small plots in unfragmented areas. Compared to six species of native ants, Argentine ants ranked lowest in their ability to tolerate high temperatures in the laboratory with 100{\%} of field-collected workers dying after 60 min of exposure to temperatures 46°C. Field data corroborate these results; mean temperatures at which colonies of Argentine ants attained maximum abundance at baits (34.0°C) and abandoned baits (41.6°C) were both lower than for the native ant Dorymyrmex insanus. Laboratory studies further revealed that low levels of soil moisture depress mean worker survival in experimental colonies of Argentine ants. In a factorial laboratory experiment that varied both physical conditions and interspecific competition, Argentine ants exhibited greater worker activity and survival under warm, moist conditions than under hot, dry conditions, whereas the presence of a competitor, Forelius mccooki, had no significant effect. Experimental colonies of F. mccooki, in contrast, were more active under hot, dry conditions than under warm, moist conditions and exhibited reduced activity in the presence of L. humile irrespective of physical conditions. Taken together, these experimental data demonstrate how the abiotic environment impinges on both colony-level activity and colony growth in the Argentine ant and provide a general explanation for the patterns observed at the community level. A key consequence of the condition-specific nature of the competitive asymmetry between Argentine ants and native ants is that community-level vulnerability to invasion appears to depend primarily on the suitability of the physical environment from the perspective of L. humile.},

abstract = {Plant regeneration is strongly determined by light and soil moisture differences between habitats; both variables are modified by large-scale forest fragmentation. Several studies have indicated this alteration as the mechanism involved in tropical forest community change. The effects of fragmentation may be much more severe in Mediterranean and deciduous forests, because plant species in these forests show a stress tolerance tradeoff between shade and drought. Our study was performed in the deciduous fragmented Coastal Maulino Forest: Reserva Nacional Los Queules (RNLQ) and surrounding small fragments. We hypothesised that Aristotelia chilensis (shade intolerant but drought tolerant) should increase its regeneration in small patches as a consequence of the change in habitat suitability (i.e. luminous and drier), while Cryptocarya alba (shade tolerant but drought intolerant) should have less regeneration in small fragments. We also expected that Nothofagus glauca and N. obliqua, which have shade and drought tolerances intermediate between A. chilensis and C. alba, should respond less to forest fragmentation. We used two estimations of plant regeneration: (i) seedling and sapling densities via field observations and (ii) seed germination and seedling establishment via a field-based experiment. Natural regeneration patterns of C. alba indicated a depressed regeneration within small forest fragments compared to RNLQ, although experimental germination, establishment and recruitment proportions did not vary between habitats. In contrast. A. chilensis regeneration was favored by forest fragmentation, with increased seedling and sapling densities and germination in small forest fragments. Both N. glauca and N. obliqua were less affected by forest fragmentation in their natural and experimental regeneration. This study highlights the relevance of studying changes in abiotic factors as a consequence of human activities, and considering safe sites (defined by regeneration niche attributes) for implementing conservation actions and ecological restoration.},

abstract = {Widespread recognition of the importance of biological studies at large spatial and temporal scales, particularly in the face of many of the most pressing issues facing humanity, has fueled the argument that there is a need to reinvigorate such studies in physiological ecology through the establishment of a macrophysiology. Following a period when the fields of ecology and physiological ecology had been regarded as largely synonymous, studies of this kind were relatively commonplace in the first half of the twentieth century. However, such large-scale work subsequently became rather scarce as physiological studies concentrated on the biochemical and molecular mechanisms underlying the capacities and tolerances of species. In some sense, macrophysiology is thus an attempt at a conceptual reunification. In this article, we provide a conceptual framework for the continued development of macrophysiology. We subdivide this framework into three major components: the establishment of macrophysiological patterns, determining the form of those patterns (the very general ways in which they are shaped), and understanding the mechanisms that give rise to them. We suggest ways in which each of these components could be developed usefully.},

abstract = {I reviewed and reconciled predictions of four models on the effect of habitat fragmentation on the population extinction threshold, and I compared these predictions to results from empirical studies. All four models predict that habitat fragmentation can, under some conditions, increase the extinction threshold such that, in more fragmented landscapes, more habitat is required for population persistence. However, empirical studies have shown both positive and negative effects of habitat fragmentation on population abundance and distribution with about equal frequency, suggesting that the models lack some important process(es). The two colonization–extinction (CE) models predict that fragmentation can increase the extinction threshold by up to 60–80{\%}; i.e., the amount of habitat required for persistence can shift from ?5{\%} of the landscape to ?80{\%} of the landscape, with a shift from completely clumped to completely fragmented habitat. The other two models (birth– immigration–death–emigration, or BIDE models) predict much smaller potential effects of fragmentation on the extinction threshold, of no more than a 10–20{\%} shift in the amount of habitat required for persistence. This difference has important implications for conser- vation. If fragmentation can have a large effect on the extinction threshold, then alteration of habitat pattern (independent of habitat amount) can be an effective tool for conservation. On the other hand, if the effects of fragmentation on the extinction threshold are small, then this is a limited option. I suggest that the difference in model predictions results from differences in the mechanisms by which the models produce the extinction threshold. In the CE models, the threshold occurs by an assumed reduction in colonization rate with decreasing habitat amount. In the BIDE models, loss of habitat is assumed to increase the proportion of the population that spends time in the matrix, where reproduction is not possible and the mortality rate is assumed to be higher (than in breeding habitat). Habitat loss therefore decreases the overall reproduction rate and increases the overall mortality rate on the landscape. I hypothesize that this imposes a constraint on the potential for habitat fragmentation to mitigate effects of habitat loss in BIDE models. To date, empirical studies of the independent effects of habitat loss and fragmentation suggest that habitat loss has a much larger effect than habitat fragmentation on the distribution and abundance of birds, supporting the BIDE model prediction, at least for this taxon.},

abstract = {Island biogeography theory (IBT) provides a basic conceptual model for understanding habitat fragmentation. Empirical studies of fragmented landscapes often reveal strong effects of fragment area and isolation on species richness, although other predictions of the theory, such as accelerated species turnover in fragments, have been tested less frequently. As predicted by IBT, biota in fragments typically 'relax' over time towards lower species richness. Beyond these broad generalizations, however, the relevance of IBT for understanding fragmented ecosystems is limited. First, IBT provides few predictions about how community composition in fragments should change over time, and which species should be most vulnerable. Second, edge effects can be an important driver of local species extinctions and ecosystem change, but are not considered by IBT. Third, the matrix of modified vegetation surrounding fragments-also ignored by IBT-can strongly influence fragment connectivity, which in turn affects the demography, genetics, and survival of local populations. Fourth, most fragmented landscapes are also altered by other anthropogenic changes, such as hunting, logging, fires, and pollution, which can interact synergistically with habitat fragmentation. Finally, fragmentation often has diverse impacts on ecosystem properties such as canopy-gap dynamics, carbon storage, and the trophic structure of communities that are not considered by IBT. I highlight these phenomena with findings from fragmented ecosystems around the world.},

abstract = {Habitat fragmentation may change local climatic conditions leading to altered selection regimes for life-history traits in small ectotherms, including several insects. We investigated temperature-related performance in terms of fitness among populations of the woodland butterfly Pararge aegeria (L.) originating from populations of a closed, continuous woodland landscape versus populations of an open, highly fragmented agricultural landscape in central Belgium. Female fecundity and longevity were evaluated in a temperature-gradient experiment. As predicted, females of woodland landscape origin reached higher maximum daily fecundity and lifetime number of eggs than did agricultural landscape females at low ambient temperatures, but this reversed at high ambient temperature. Egg weight decreased with temperature, and eggs of woodland butterflies were smaller. Contrary to what is generally assumed, remaining thorax mass was a better predictor of lifetime reproductive output than was abdomen mass. Since we used the F2 generation from wild-caught females reared under common garden conditions, the observed effects are likely to rely on intrinsic, heritable variation. Our results suggest that differential selection regimes associated with different landscapes intervene by intraspecific variation in the response of a butterfly to variation in ambient temperature, and may thus be helpful when making predictions of future impacts on how wild populations respond to environmental conditions under a global change scenario, with increasing temperatures and fragmented landscapes.},

abstract = {Temperature is one of the most important factors that determine plant growth, development, and yield. Accurate summarization of plant temperature response is thus a prerequisite to successful crop systems modelling and application of such models to management. This paper reports on a general equation that can be used to simulate the temperature response of plants. The equation reads as r=Rmax(Tmax-TTmax - Topt) (TTopt)ToptTmax - Topt, where r is the daily rate of growth (or development) at any temperature, Toptis the optimum temperature, Tmaxis the maximum temperature, and Rmaxis the maximum rate of growth or development at Topt. It has the smallest number of parameters possible to simulate the plant response to the full range of temperatures relevant to plant growth and development. The equation was shown to successfully simulate the growth and development of maize, bean, wheat, barley, sorghum, and lambsquarters. The adjusted R -square of fit ranged from 0.747 to 0.998, mostly greater than 0.9. For one maize dataset that contains independent data, the equation was shown to be highly predictive. The equation could find application in crop germplasm classification, crop modelling and environmental control of artificial crop production systems. Copyright 1999 Annals of Botany Company},

abstract = {Th e conceptual foundations of habitat fragmentation research have not kept pace with empirical advances in our under- standing of species responses to landscape change, nor with theoretical advances in the wider disciplines of ecology. Th ere is now real debate whether explicit recognition of ‘ habitat fragmentation ' as an over-arching conceptual domain will stimulate or hinder further progress toward understanding and mitigating the eff ects of landscape change. In this paper, we critically challenge the conceptual foundations of the discipline, and attempt to derive an integrated perspective on the best way to advance mechanistic understanding of fragmentation processes. We depict the inherent assumptions underly- ing the discipline as a ‘ conceptual phase space ' of contrasting false dichotomies in fragmentation ‘ problem space ' . In our opinion, the key determinant of whether ‘ habitat fragmentation ' can remain a cohesive framework lies in the concept of ‘ interdependence ' : 1) interdependence of landscape eff ects on species and 2) interdependence of species responses to landscape change. If there is non-trivial interdependence among the various sub-components of habitat fragmentation, or non-trivial interdependence among species responses to landscape change, then there will be real heuristic value in ‘ habitat fragmentation ' as a single conceptual domain. At present, the current paradigms entrenched in the fragmentation literature are implicitly founded on strict independence of landscape eff ects (e.g. the debate about the independent eff ects of habitat loss versus fragmentation per se) and strict independence of species responses (e.g. the individualistic species response models underpinning landscape continuum models), despite compelling evidence for interdependence in both eff ects and responses to fragmentation. We discuss how strong ‘ interdependence ' of eff ects and responses challenges us to rethink long- held views, and re-cast the conceptual foundations of habitat fragmentation in terms of spatial context-dependence in the eff ects of multiple interacting spatial components of fragmentation, and community context-dependence in the responses of multiple interacting species to landscape change.

abstract = {Predicting when, where and with what magnitude climate change is likely to affect the fitness, abundance and distribution of organisms and the functioning of ecosystems has emerged as a high priority for scientists and resource managers. However, even in cases where we have detailed knowledge of current species' range boundaries, we often do not understand what, if any, aspects of weather and climate act to set these limits. This shortcoming significantly curtails our capacity to predict potential future range shifts in response to climate change, especially since the factors that set range boundaries under those novel conditions may be different from those that set limits today. We quantitatively examine a nine-year time series of temperature records relevant to the body temperatures of intertidal mussels as measured using biomimetic sensors. Specifically, we explore how a 'climatology' of body temperatures, as opposed to long-term records of habitat-level parameters such as air and water temperatures, can be used to extrapolate meaningful spatial and temporal patterns of physiological stress. Using different metrics that correspond to various aspects of physiological stress (seasonal means, cumulative temperature and the return time of extremes) we show that these potential environmental stressors do not always occur in synchrony with one another. Our analysis also shows that patterns of animal temperature are not well correlated with simple, commonly used metrics such as air temperature. Detailed physiological studies can provide guidance to predicting the effects of global climate change on natural ecosystems but only if we concomitantly record, archive and model environmental signals at appropriate scales.},

The aspen grove was burned on 5 May 1995 as part of the management program for the Kernen Prairie, and microclimatic measurements were continued for a further 2 years. The fire removed almost the entire understory and killed most of the trees in the grove. However, many of the dead trees remained standing until knocked over by strong winds. Before burning, the trees leafed out in summer, shading the ground and producing a low density of grasses and shrubs beneath the main tree canopy. After burning, growth of brome grass and aspen suckers provided a dense covering close to the ground, in response to higher solar radiation. The main changes to grove microclimate by burning were higher radiation intensities, windspeeds, and daytime temperatures near the ground during the summer. This paper describes the microclimates of the aspen grove before and after burning, in comparison with that of the surrounding prairie. The importance of such groves as wildlife habitat, and the ecological significance of the post, fire microclimate are discussed.},

abstract = {The acute thermal tolerance of ectotherms has been measured in a variety of ways; these include assays where organisms are shifted abruptly to stressful temperatures and assays where organisms experience temperatures that are ramped more slowly to stressful levels. Ramping assays are thought to be more relevant to natural conditions where sudden abrupt shifts are unlikely to occur often, but it has been argued that thermal limits established under ramping conditions are underestimates of true thermal limits because stresses due to starvation and/or desiccation can arise under ramping. These confounding effects might also impact the variance and heritability of thermal tolerance. We argue here that ramping assays are useful in capturing aspects of ecological relevance even though there is potential for confounding effects of other stresses that can also influence thermal limits in nature. Moreover, we show that the levels of desiccation and starvation experienced by ectotherms in ramping assays will often be minor unless the assays involve small animals and last for many hours. Empirical data illustrate that the combined effects of food and humidity on thermal limits under ramping and sudden shifts to stressful conditions are unpredictable; in Drosophila melanogaster the presence of food decreased rather than increased thermal limits, whereas in Ceratitis capitata they had little impact. The literature provides examples where thermal limits are increased under ramping presumably because of the potential for physiological changes leading to acclimation. It is unclear whether heritabilities and population differentiation will necessarily be lower under ramping because of confounding effects. Although it is important to clearly define experimental methods, particularly when undertaking comparative assessments, and to understand potential confounding effects, thermotolerance assays based on ramping remain an important tool for understanding and predicting species responses to environmental change. An important area for further development is to identify the impact of rates of temperature change under field and laboratory conditions.},

abstract = {Habitat fragmentation imposes profound impacts on the tropical forest microclimate, but the microclimatic configuration of isolated forest patches and its implications for biodiversity persistence and habitat management are not clear. In this study we assessed a set of 10 aged ({\textgreater} 80 years) fragments (3.0 - 3,500 ha in size) of the Atlantic forest to examine to what extent fragment microclimatic attributes are correlated with distance to the nearest edge as frequently proposed in the literature. We used 129 sampling points and took a total of 516 measures of air temperature and humidity, vapor pressure deficit and light incidence to characterize the microclimate of forest fragments in terms of their relative deviation from the surrounding matrix. Fragments as a whole presented strong internal variation and strongly differed from the microclimate exhibited by the open matrix of sugar-cane fields. Distance to nearest edge, percentage of forest cover around the measurement point, percentage of edge-affected area, and geographical orientation of the nearest edge all proved to have minor effects on the microclimate of forest fragments. Conversely, we identified percentage of forest cover and fragment area as the most significant explanatory variables driving their microclimatic configuration: as forest cover increases at landscape scale, forest microclimate deviates less from the open matrix (a forest-mediated matrix buffering). Our results suggest that microclimatic conditions are spatially complex, as they do not correlate with the distance to the nearest forest edges; rather, they are driven by a forest-mediated buffering of the surrounding matrix that minimizes heat and humidity exchanges between forest and non-forest habitats, thus shaping the microclimatic signature of isolated forest fragments. {\textcopyright} Severino R.

Here, we show how macrophysiology--the investigation of variation in physiological traits over large geographical, temporal and phylogenetic scales--can contribute significantly to answering these questions. We do so by demonstrating, for each of the MA drivers, how a macrophysiological approach can or has helped elucidate the impacts of these drivers and their interactions. Moreover, we illustrate that a large-scale physiological perspective can provide insights into previously unrecognized threats to diversity, such as the erosion of physiological variation and stress tolerance, which are a consequence of the removal of large species and individuals from the biosphere. In so doing we demonstrate that environmental physiologists have much to offer the scientific quest to resolve major environmental problems.},

abstract = {Edge structure is one of the principal determinants of the extent and magnitude of edge effects in forest fragments. In central Amazonia, natural succession at forest edges typically produces a dense wall of vegetation dominated by Cecropia spp. that buffers the forest interior. Fire encroachment into forest edges, however, eliminates the soil seed bank, enhances plant mortality, and promotes succession to an open, Vismia-dominated edge that does not buffer the forest interior. Contrasting open, fire-encroached forest edges and closed, non-fire-encroached edges were examined in central Amazonia to assess the effects of edge structure on microclimate and vegetation structure in tropical forest fragments. Edge penetration distances for most microclimate and vegetation structure variables were as much as two to five times greater at open edges than at closed edges. The magnitude of these differences suggests that edge structure is one of the main determinants of microclimate and vegetation structure within tropical forest fragments. Edge effects also varied systematically with fragment area. For a given edge type, 100-ha fragments had consistently lower canopy height, higher foliage density, higher temperature, a higher rate of evaporative drying, lower leaf litter moisture content, and lower litter depth than continuous forest, at all distances from the forest edge. These differences, however, were relatively minor compared to the striking differences in edge penetration between open and closed forest edges. For organisms in small fragments, the difference between open and closed edges may be the difference between total edge encroachment on one hand and an effective nature reserve on the other, relatively independent of absolute fragment area.},
