abstract = {Electronic tracking tags have revolutionized our understanding of broad-scale movements and habitat use of highly mobile marine animals, but a large gap in our knowledge still remains for a wide range of small species. Here, we report the extraordinary transequatorial postbreeding migrations of a small seabird, the sooty shearwater, obtained with miniature archival tags that log data for estimating position, dive depth, and ambient temperature. Tracks (262+/-23 days) reveal that shearwaters fly across the entire Pacific Ocean in a figure-eight pattern while traveling 64,037+/-9,779 km roundtrip, the longest animal migration ever recorded electronically. Each shearwater made a prolonged stopover in one of three discrete regions off Japan, Alaska, or California before returning to New Zealand through a relatively narrow corridor in the central Pacific Ocean. Transit rates as high as 910+/-186 km.day-1 were recorded, and shearwaters accessed prey resources in both the Northern and Southern Hemisphere's most productive waters from the surface to 68.2 m depth. Our results indicate that sooty shearwaters integrate oceanic resources throughout the Pacific Basin on a yearly scale. Sooty shearwater populations today are declining, and because they operate on a global scale, they may serve as an important indicator of climate change and ocean health.},

@article{Ko2006,
abstract = {Circadian rhythms are approximately 24-h oscillations in behavior and physiology, which are internally generated and function to anticipate the environmental changes associated with the solar day. A conserved transcriptional-translational autoregulatory loop generates molecular oscillations of 'clock genes' at the cellular level. In mammals, the circadian system is organized in a hierarchical manner, in which a master pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) regulates downstream oscillators in peripheral tissues. Recent findings have revealed that the clock is cell-autonomous and self-sustained not only in a central pacemaker, the SCN, but also in peripheral tissues and in dissociated cultured cells. It is becoming evident that specific contribution of each clock component and interactions among the components vary in a tissue-specific manner. Here, we review the general mechanisms of the circadian clockwork, describe recent findings that elucidate tissue-specific expression patterns of the clock genes and address the importance of circadian regulation in peripheral tissues for an organism's overall well-being.},

abstract = {The ecological processes that are crucial to an animal's growth, survival, and reproductive fitness have energetic costs. The imperative for an animal to meet these costs within the energetic constraints of the environment drives many aspects of animal ecology and evolution, yet has largely been overlooked in traditional ecological paradigms. The field of 'ecological energetics' is bringing comparative physiology out of the laboratory and, for the first time, is becoming broadly accessible to field ecologists addressing real-world questions at many spatial and temporal scales. In an era of unprecedented global environmental challenges, ecological energetics opens up the tantalising prospect of a more predictive, mechanistic understanding of the drivers of threatened species decline, delivering process-based modelling approaches to natural resource management.},

@article{Tøttrup2012,
abstract = {The small size of the billions of migrating songbirds commuting between temperate breeding sites and the tropics has long prevented the study of the largest part of their annual cycle outside the breeding grounds. Using light-level loggers (geolocators), we recorded the entire annual migratory cycle of the red-backed shrike Lanius collurio, a trans-equatorial Eurasian-African passerine migrant. We tested differences between autumn and spring migration for nine individuals. Duration of migration between breeding and winter sites was significantly longer in autumn (average 96 days) when compared with spring (63 days). This difference was explained by much longer staging periods during autumn (71 days) than spring (9 days). Between staging periods, the birds travelled faster during autumn (356 km d(-1)) than during spring (233 km d(-1)). All birds made a protracted stop (53 days) in Sahelian sub-Sahara on southbound migration. The birds performed a distinct loop migration (22 000 km) where spring distance, including a detour across the Arabian Peninsula, exceeded the autumn distance by 22 per cent. Geographical scatter between routes was particularly narrow in spring, with navigational convergence towards the crossing point from Africa to the Arabian Peninsula. Temporal variation between individuals was relatively constant, while different individuals tended to be consistently early or late at different departure/arrival occasions during the annual cycle. These results demonstrate the existence of fundamentally different spatio-temporal migration strategies used by the birds during autumn and spring migration, and that songbirds may rely on distinct staging areas for completion of their annual cycle, suggesting more sophisticated endogenous control mechanisms than merely clock-and-compass guidance among terrestrial solitary migrants. After a century with metal-ringing, year-round tracking of long-distance migratory songbirds promises further insights into bird migration.},

abstract = {Area and available energy are major determinants of species richness. Although scale dependency of the relationship between energy availability and species richness (the species-energy relationship) has been documented, the exact relationship between the species-area and the species-energy relationship has not been studied explicitly. Here we show, using two extensive data sets on avian distributions in different biogeographic regions, that there is a negative interaction between energy availability and area in their effect on species richness. The slope of the species-area relationship is lower in areas with higher levels of available energy, and the slope of the species-energy relationship is lower for larger areas. This three-dimensional species-area-energy relationship can be understood in terms of probabilistic processes affecting the proportions of sites occupied by individual species. According to this theory, high environmental energy elevates species' occupancies, which depress the slope of the species-area curve.},

abstract = {We explore in this paper how animals can be affected by variation in climate, topography, vegetation characteristics, and body size. We utilize new spatially explicit state-of-the-art models that incorporate principles from heat and mass transfer engineering, physiology, morphology, and behavior that have been modified to provide spatially explicit hypotheses using GIS. We demonstrate how temporal and spatial changes in microclimate resulting from differences in topography and vegetation cover alter animal energetics, and behavior. We explore the impacts of these energetic predictions on elk energetics in burned and unburned stands of conifer in winter in Yellowstone National Park, chuckwalla lizard distribution limits in North America, California Beechey Ground squirrel and Dusky Footed woodrat mass and energy requirements and activity patterns on the landscape, their predator prey interactions with a rattlesnake, Crotalus viridis, and shifts in that food web structure due to topographic and vegetative variation. We illustrate how different scales of data/observation provide different pieces of information that may collectively define the real distributions of a species. We then use sensitivity analyses of energetic models to evaluate hypotheses about the effects of changes in core temperature (fever) global climate (increased air temperature under a global warming scenario) and vegetation cover (deforestation) on winter survival of elk, the geographic distribution of chuckwallas and the activity overlap of predator and prey species within a subset of commonly observed species in a terrestrial food web. Variation in slope and aspect affect the spatial variance in solar radiation incident on the ground, hence ground surface temperature, at the same elevation, same hourly 2 m air temperatures, and wind speeds. We illustrate visually how spatial effects and landscape heterogeneity make statistical descriptions of animal responses problematic, since multiple distributions of their responses to climate, topography, and vegetation on the landscape can yield the same descriptive statistics, especially at high (30 m) resolution. This preliminary analysis suggests that the model has far-reaching implications for hypothesis testing in ecology at a variety of spatial and temporal scales.},

@article{Wikelski2000,
abstract = {Tropical wet forests are commonly perceived as stable and constant envi- ronments. However, many rain forest organisms reproduce seasonally. To understand the proximate regulation of life history events in tropical organisms, we asked three questions: (1) How predictable are seasonal changes in the tropical rain forest? (2) Can tropical organisms anticipate environmental seasonality, despite the presumed lack of long-term environmental cues in near-equatorial areas? (3) What environmental cues can tropical organisms use? We studied Spotted Antbirds, monogamous understory insectivores, which started breeding in Panama (9 N) in May (wet season) and continued until September/ October. Breeding patterns were consistent between years, indicating that tropical seasons were as predictable for Spotted Antbirds (predictability 70{\%}) as they are for many north temperate birds. Individual Spotted Antbirds shut down reproductive capacity (i.e., de- creased gonad size) from October until February. In March, during the height of the dry season and about six weeks ahead of the wet season, gonads started to grow again. The growth rate of gonads was influenced by the amount of rainfall, which has been shown to correlate with food abundance. Gonad growth was paralleled by changes in luteinizing hormone, but not in testosterone, which remained at very low plasma levels year-round. The latter contrasts with the pattern for most migratory temperate-zone birds. Seasonal changes in reproductive activity correlated strongly with changes in the tropical photoperiod, but weakly with light intensity and rainfall, and not with temperature. Thus, Spotted Ant- birds likely anticipated rain forest seasonality using long-term cues (tropical photoperiod) and fine-tuned their reproductive activities using short-term cues (food/rainfall). The use of long-term environmental information could apply to most vertebrate species that live in the tropics.},

abstract = {In the field of celestial calculations, Jean Meeus has enjoyed wide acclaim and respect since long before microcomputers and pocket calculators appeared on the market. When he brought out his Astronomical Formulae for Calculators in 1979, it was practically the only book of its genre. It quickly became the "source among sources," even for other writers in the field. Many of them have warmly acknowledged their debt (or should have), citing the unparalleled clarity of his instructions and the rigor of his methods. And now this Belgian astronomer has outdone himself yet again with Astronomical Algorithms! Virtually every previous handbook on celestial calculations (including his own earlier work) was forced to rely on formulae for the Sun, Moon, and planets that were developed in the last century — or at least before 1920. The past 10 years, however, have seen a stunning revolution in how the world's major observatories produce their almanacs. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California and the U.S. Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C., have perfected powerful new machine methods for modeling the motions and interactions of bodies within the solar system. At the same time in Paris, the Bureau des Longitudes has been a beehive of activity aimed at describing these motions analytically, in the form of explicit equations. Yet until now the fruits of this exciting work have remained mostly out of reach of ordinary people. The details have existed mainly on reels of magnetic tape in a form comprehensible only to the largest brains, human or electronic. But Astronomical Algorithms changes all that. With his special knack for computations of all sorts, the author has made the essentials of these modern techniques available to us all. The second edition contains new chapters about the Jewish and Moslem Calendars, and on the satellites of Saturn, and a new Appendix giving expressions (polynomials) for the heliocentric coordinates of the giant planets Jupiter to Neptune from 1998 to 2025.},

abstract = {Ten satellite tracks of Whooper Swans migrating between Iceland and Britain or Ireland were analysed in relation to detailed weather and astronomical data. Surface pressure, visibility, cloud cover, precipitation intensity and type, sun altitude and moon altitude were estimated separately for each of 414 location points, of which 217 were over land or offshore islands, and 197 were over the open sea. Height profiles for four northbound and four southbound flights included two swans that flew continuously for most or all of the sea crossing, one of which reached 1856 m asl, the maximum height recorded. The others flew low, and landed often on the water, sometimes for prolonged periods. Elapsed times for the sea crossing varied from 12.7 to 101 hours. Statistical analysis showed that the swans tended to move onward during the sea crossings, provided that the altitude above the horizon of either the sun or the moon was higher than -4d̀, and also that the visibility was greater than 2 km; otherwise, they tended to stop on the water. This effect was seen only when the swans were crossing the open sea, not when they were flying over land or islands. It was interpreted as suggesting that they need a visible horizon to navigate when out of sight of land. If this inference is correct, it would eliminate the possibility that the swans use inertial navigation, but strengthen the case for celestial navigation.},

M,,,, of Red Knots resting in different microhabitats was estimated on the basis of measurements with heated taxidermic mounts, which were calibrated with forced con- vection against postabsorptive live birds resting over a range of air temperatures (i.e., against their Standard Metabolic Rate). Based on a physically realistic regression model for heat loss, we established the relationships between the electric power consumption of the mounts and three critical weather variables affecting dry heat loss: air temperature, wind speed and global solar radiation. Observations of Red Knots' use of different microhabitats (including their occurrence in flocks of different bird density) and orientation into the wind were collected on the wintering and on the breeding grounds. At lower standard operative tem- peratures on the coastal wintering grounds they foraged in tighter flocks and more often faced into the wind, saving 8{\%} compared to solitary birds standing with their flanks exposed. We then used (1) microhabitat-specific equations, (2) long-term meteorological data sets, and (3) estimates of habitat use and wind orientation of free-living Red Knots at the different locations and times of the year, to reconstruct the seasonal patterns in M,,,, in the field. Average predicted M,,,, varied between 2.93 W in January and 1.64 W in August on the Dutch wintering areas. The maximum monthly M,,,, in winter was higher than that reached on the Canadian breeding grounds (2.28 W, or 0.78 times the Dutch January cost) and on the Icelandic staging grounds (2.27 W, or 0.77 x the Dutch cost in January, in spring, and 1.98 W, or 0.68 x , in fall). Based on 3 1 years of weather data from the Dutch Wadden Sea in the period 1960-1991 (assuming that Red Knots have not changed their behavior), the long-term overwinter average of M,,,, was 2.57 W, with an average monthly minimum of 1.87 W and a maximum of 3.05 W. The west-central coast of France, 900 km more to the south, offers energetically cheaper conditions (0.76 x values for the Dutch coast in January) in the nonbreeding season than the Wadden Sea. If islandica knots moved on to West Africa during the nonbreeding season they would incur a saving of 1.13 W on M,,,,,, and pay an extra 0.13-0.22 W to cover the cost of travel.},

abstract = {Migratory animals are comprised of a complex series of interconnected breeding and nonbreeding populations. Because individuals in any given population can arrive from a variety of sites the previous season, predicting how different populations will respond to environmental change can be challenging. In this study, we develop a population model composed of a network of breeding and wintering sites to show how habitat loss affects patterns of connectivity and species abundance. When the costs of migration are evenly distributed, habitat loss at a single site can increase the degree of connectivity (mixing) within the entire network, which then acts to buffer global populations from declines. However, the degree to which populations are buffered depends on where habitat loss occurs within the network: a site that has the potential to receive individuals from multiple populations in the opposite season will lead to smaller declines than a site that is more isolated. In other cases when there are equal costs of migration to two or more sites in the opposite season, habitat loss can result in some populations becoming segregated (disconnected) from the rest of the network. The geographic structure of the network can have a significant influence on relative population sizes of sites in the same season and can also affect the overall degree of mixing in the network, even when sites are of equal intrinsic quality. When a migratory network is widely spaced and migration costs are high, an equivalent habitat loss will lead to a larger decline in global population size than will occur in a network where the overall costs of migration are low. Our model provides an important foundation to test predictions related to habitat loss in real-world migratory networks and demonstrates that migratory networks will likely produce different dynamics from traditional metapopulations. Our results provide strong evidence that estimating population connectivity is a prerequisite for successfully predicting changes in migratory populations.},

abstract = {Movement is important to all organisms, and accordingly it is addressed in a huge number of papers in the literature. Of nearly 26,000 papers referring to movement, an estimated 34{\%} focused on movement by measuring it or testing hypotheses about it. This enormous amount of information is difficult to review and highlights the need to assess the collective completeness of movement studies and identify gaps. We surveyed 1,000 randomly selected papers from 496 journals and compared the facets of movement studied with a suggested framework for movement ecology, consisting of internal state (motivation, physiology), motion and navigation capacities, and external factors (both the physical environment and living organisms), and links among these components. Most studies simply measured and described the movement of organisms without reference to ecological or internal factors, and the most frequently studied part of the framework was the link between external factors and motion capacity. Few studies looked at the effects on movement of navigation capacity, or internal state, and those were mainly from vertebrates. For invertebrates and plants most studies were at the population level, whereas more vertebrate studies were conducted at the individual level. Consideration of only population-level averages promulgates neglect of between-individual variation in movement, potentially hindering the study of factors controlling movement. Terminology was found to be inconsistent among taxa and subdisciplines. The gaps identified in coverage of movement studies highlight research areas that should be addressed to fully understand the ecology of movement.},

abstract = {The field thermal biology of sympatric Anolis cooki and A. eristateIlus were evaluated in January and in August in desert scrub forest at Playa de Tamarindo near Guanica, Puerto Rico. Data on randomly posi- tioned copper models of lizards, each equipped with a built-in thermocouple, established null hypotheses about basking frequency and operative temperatures (T{\~{}}) against which the behavior and body temperatures (Tb) of live lizards were evaluated. Both species exhibited non-random hourly basking rates (more marked in cris- tatellus than in cooki), and cristatellus was virtually inac- tive during the warm mid-day hours. The relationship between lizards' T b and randomly sampled T{\~{}} differed between the species: eristatellus's mean Tb was 2 {\~{}} to 3 {\~{}} C lower than randomly sampled mean To in both months, whereas cooki's mean Tb was slightly higher than mean T{\~{}} in January and slightly lower in August. Although cooki's mean T b was higher than that of cristatellus in both months, the Tb'S of the two species overlapped substantially over an annual cycle. Given the similarities in their field active T b and the low thermal heterogeneity among microsites at Playa de Tamarindo, these species appear not to partition the thermal environment there in a coarse-grained way. Instead, the relatively small dif- ferences in their field active T b probably result from small differences in their use of similar microhabitats within their mutually exclusive territories. Thermal resource partitioning by territorial animals is unlikely unless ther- mal heterogeneity is coarse-grained in relation to territo- ry size},

abstract = {Migratory birds are predicted to adapt their departure to wind, changing their threshold of departure and selectivity of the most favourable winds in relation to the mean, scatter and skewness of the wind regime. The optimal departure behaviour depends also on the importance of time and energy minimization during migration and on the ratio of cost of flight to cost of resting and waiting for more favourable winds. We compared departure and flight activity of shorebirds migrating in contrasting wind regimes during autumn (high probability of wind resistance) and spring (high probability of wind assistance) in southern Scandinavia, using data obtained by radiotelemetry, radar tracking and visual observations. The shorebirds changed their threshold for departure in relation to wind between the two seasons, flying almost exclusively with wind assistance in spring but regularly with wind resistance during autumn. The degree of wind selectivity in relation to the distributions of available wind effects was similar during autumn and spring indicating that reducing time and energy costs for migration was important during both seasons. These results demonstrate that migratory birds change departure behaviour in relation to the prevailing wind regime. It remains unknown whether they change behaviour not only seasonally but also in different zones along the migration route and whether they respond to differences not only in mean wind conditions but also in scatter and skewness between wind regimes. Our study indicates the possible existence of an adaptive flexibility in responses to wind regimes among migratory birds. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract = {Whole-plant energy capture depends not only on the photosynthetic response of individual leaves, but also on their integration into an effective canopy, and on the costs of producing and maintaining their photosynthetic capacity. This paper explores adaptation to irradiance level in this context, focusing on traits whose significance would be elusive if considered in terms of their impact at the leaf level alone. I review traditional approaches used to demonstrate or suggest adaptation to irradiance level, and outline three energetic tradeoffs likely to shape such adaptation, involving the economics of gas exchange, support, and biotic interactions. Recent models using these tradeoffs to account for trends in leaf nitrogen content, stornatal conductance, phyllotaxis, and defensive allocations in sun v. shade are evaluated. A re-evaluation of the classic study of acclimation of the photosynthetic light response in Atriplex, crucial to interpreting adaptation to irradiance in many traits, shows that it does not completely support the central dogma of adaptation to sun v. shade unless the results are analysed in terms of whole-plant energy capture. Calculations for Liriodendron show that the traditional light compensation point has little meaning for net carbon gain, and that the effective compensation point is profoundly influenced by the costs of night leaf respiration, leaf construction, and the construction of associated support and root tissue. The costs of support tissue are especially important, raising the effective compensation point by 140 µmol m-2 s-1 in trees 1 m tall, and by nearly 1350 µmol m-2 s-1 in trees 30 m tall. Effective compensation points give maximum tree heights as a function of irradiance, and shade tolerance as a function of tree height; calculations of maximum permissible height in Liriodendron correspond roughly with the height of the tallest known individual. Finally, new models for the evolution of canopy width/height ratio in response to irradiance and coverage within a tree stratum, and for the evolution of mottled leaves as a defensive measure in understory herbs, are outlined.},

abstract = {Phenology refers to the periodic appearance of life-cycle events and currently receives abundant attention as the effects of global change on phenology are so apparent. Phenology as a discipline observes these events and relates their annual variation to variation in climate. But phenology is also studied in other disciplines, each with their own perspective. Evolutionary ecologists study variation in seasonal timing and its fitness consequences, whereas chronobiologists emphasize the periodic nature of life-cycle stages and their underlying timing programmes (e.g. circannual rhythms). The (neuro-) endocrine processes underlying these life-cycle events are studied by physiologists and need to be linked to genes that are explored by molecular geneticists. In order to fully understand variation in phenology, we need to integrate these different perspectives, in particular by combining evolutionary and mechanistic approaches. We use avian research to characterize different perspectives and to highlight integration that has already been achieved. Building on this work, we outline a route towards uniting the different disciplines in a single framework, which may be used to better understand and, more importantly, to forecast climate change impacts on phenology.},
annote = {Intro







- some species show extreme reliability in year-to-year phenology (i.e. birds) while others show great variation between years. 
- temperate zone, temperature usually the best predictor of phenology.
- needed -- ability to predict phenology shifts well outside the current projected range of observed data to address climate change. Hence, we need a unified framework that incorporates an ecological and evolutionary prospective. 
- look up -- cirannual thythms.







Different Perspectives







-Phenologists -- record life-cycle events over long periods of time and relate the inter-annual variations to climatic variables.
- focus on seasonal recurrence in its own right.
- focus on first individuals or population mean rather than variation among individuals of the population.
- Individual approach -- The date that something happens is a phenotype and should be treated accordingly.
- variation in date will be the result of phenotypic plastisity and is this shaped by the interaction between the genotype and the environment.
- Evolutionary ecologist -- refer to it as "seasonal timing." Emphasize variation among individuals within years and between years. 
- "birds have been selected for their ability to have their chicks in the nest at the time of peak food abundance." -- I think the link to evolution is correct, but I don't think it has as much to do with food as it does with temperature. 
- have birds evoloved the ability to CORRECTLY interpret proximate cues (interpreted well before the actual breeding event) to hit a particular optimal date?
- cues should provide the ability to predict the future environment under which the phenotype will be selected. Including: conspecific and multi-trophic interactions. 
- these cues must actually be a suite of cues on a multi-dimensional enivronmental axis. 
- Mainly study organisms in the wild to observe fitness benifits and selection events on timing.
- Physiologists -- how do the changes within annual cycles causally come about? How can environmental cues adjust morphology, physiology, and behaviour over an annual schedule?
- strong emphasis on photoperiod. 
- hypothalamo-pituitary-honadal (HPG) axis is the well studied mechanism for translating photoperiod cues to behavioral action in birds.
- shown that temp, social, moisture, and food availability cues are also important, but the mechanism for translation is not as well known as the HPG axis.
- most of this work is done at the individual behavioral level, in a lab.
- test usually conducted under controlled temp (usually warmer than natural conditions and constant) with a heavy bias toward males rather than females (because females usually don't reach full reproductive maturity in captivity). 
- one useful proxy used in field experiments is gonadal development rather than actual egg laying. 
- Chronobiologist -- focus on internal timing programmes that enable organisms to cope with, and anticipate, geophysical cycles in the enivronment.
- this is the internal clock that persists even without external cues. 
-work on daily or yearly cycles
- seperate period (length of cycle) from phase (time when that cycle occurs). 
- less interested in variation between years or individuals 
- focus on avvual cycle and variation over the year.
- events occur based on the interplay between internal time-structuring and environmental cues. 
- seasonal clock determines how sensitive an animal is to external cues. The individual will respond to cues during some times of the year and not others. 
- for birds -- the circadian clock internally references 24 hours for the bird to compare the photoperiod to, to determine if a day is "long" (larger proportion of 24) or "short" (smaller proportion of 24). 
- If the bird is in the correct phase for photostimulation, a cascade of gene expression starts. 
- includes citations for comparisons of this process between different taxa. 
- Molecular Geneticist -- what are the genes controlling timing and how do those genes vary between individuals.
- have shown that a latitudinal gradient exists in the mean repeat lenght (more repeats at hight lats) exists in the one known candidate gene for timing. 
- females with shorter repeat lengths layed eggs earlier. 
- these studies completely absent in wild birds. 
- OTL studies are monitoring gene expression to try to find the genes controlling these cycles. Looking at both the genes that do the work and the genes that set that work into motion. 







Integration toward a single framework







- evolution is the primary controlling force. phenotype controlled by selection.
-relatively small changes in reproduction date have large fitness consequences. 
-because fitness consequences depend on a species' ecology, and the particular environment, "there is no single mechanism that fits all species."
-- I don't think this is exactly true... I'm trying to define the environment 
within with species or individual 
compete and set their date.
-a crucial step is taking account of variation between species or populations, as well as between individuals with a population. 
- 



















































animals must use cues to predict selection



















































. 
- so, the animal will use a cue that predicts indirect effects. i.e. precip -{\textgreater} grass -{\textgreater} food source.
- quails require a combined reduction in temperature and photoperiod to stop reproduction entirely.

abstract = {The 1980s saw the emergence of a new approach that is both enhancing our understanding of climatic change on geologic time scales and providing insight into the impact of these climatic changes on the continental and marine biota. This approach (loosely termed 'data-model comparisons') has been applied both to glacial-interglacial changes occurring during the last three million years and driven by variations in the earth's orbit around the sun, and to the slower climatic changes occurring over much longer time scales and driven by tectonic processes. The strength of this approach lies in comparing the results of two independent ways of studying the climate system, and thus providing insight into the strengths and weaknesses of each. Comparisons are made between climatic changes simulated by experiments with General Circulation Models and those reconstructed from fossils. Close agreement between the results of these two independent techniques implies that the key physical processes acting within the climate system have been identified; fundamental mismatches motivate re-examination of both the models and the fossil biotic data.},

abstract = {Migration, the seasonal movement of individuals among different locations, is a behavior found throughout the animal kingdom. Although migration is widely studied at taxonomically restricted levels, cross-taxonomic syntheses of migration are less common. As a result, we lack answers to broad questions such as what ultimate factors generally drive animal migration. Here we present such a synthesis by using a spatially explicit, individual-based model in which we evolve behavior rules via simulations under a wide range of ecological conditions to answer two questions. First, under what types of ecological conditions can an individual maximize its fitness by migrating (vs. being a resident)? Second, what types of information do individuals use to guide their movement? We show that migration is selected for when resource distributions are dominated more by seasonality than by local patchiness, and residency (nonmigratory behavior) is selected for when the reverse is true. When selected for, migration evolves as both a movement behavior and an information usage strategy. We also find that different types of migration can evolve, depending on the ecological conditions and availability of information. Finally, we present empirical support for our main results, drawn from migration patterns exhibited by a variety of taxonomic groups.},

abstract = {1. Global climate has changed significantly during the past 30 years and especially in northern temperate regions which have experienced poleward shifts in temperature regimes. While there is evidence that some species have responded by moving their distributions to higher latitudes, the efficiency of this response in tracking species' climatic niche boundaries over time has yet to be addressed. 2. Here, we provide a continental assessment of the temporal structure of species responses to recent spatial shifts in climatic conditions. We examined geographic associations with minimum winter temperature for 59 species of winter avifauna at 476 Christmas Bird Count circles in North America from 1975 to 2009 under three sampling schemes that account for spatial and temporal sampling effects. 3. Minimum winter temperature associated with species occurrences showed an overall increase with a weakening trend after 1998. Species displayed highly variable responses that, on average and across sampling schemes, contained a strong lag effect that weakened in strength over time. In general, the conservation of minimum winter temperature was relevant when all species were considered together but only after an initial lag period (c. 35 years) was overcome. The delayed niche tracking observed at the combined species level was likely supported by the post1998 lull in the warming trend. 4. There are limited geographic and ecological explanations for the observed variability, suggesting that the efficiency of species' responses under climate change is likely to be highly idiosyncratic and difficult to predict. This outcome is likely to be even more pronounced and time lags more persistent for less vagile taxa, particularly during the periods of consistent or accelerating warming. Current modelling efforts and conservation strategies need to better appreciate the variation, strength and duration of lag effects and their association with climatic variability. Conservation strategies in particular will benefit through identifying and maintaining dispersal corridors that accommodate diverging dispersal strategies and timetables.},

abstract = {Gliding saves much energy, and to make large distances using only this form of flight represents a great challenge for both birds and people. The solution is to make use of the so-called thermals, which are localized, warmer regions in the atmosphere moving upwards with a speed exceeding the descent rate of bird and plane. Whereas birds use this technique mainly for foraging, humans do it as a sporting activity. Thermalling involves efficient optimization including the skilful localization of thermals, trying to guess the most favorable route, estimating the best descending rate, etc. In this study, we address the question whether there are any analogies between the solutions birds and humans find to handle the above task. High-resolution track logs were taken from thermalling falcons and paraglider pilots to determine the essential parameters of the flight patterns. We find that there are relevant common features in the ways birds and humans use thermals. In particular, falcons seem to reproduce the MacCready formula widely used by gliders to calculate the best slope to take before an upcoming thermal.},

abstract = {Life evolves in a cyclic environment, and to be successful, organisms must adapt not only to their spatial habitat, but also to their temporal habitat. How do plants and animals determine the time of year so they can anticipate seasonal changes in their habitats? In most cases, day length, or photoperiod, acts as the principal external cue for determining seasonal activity. For organisms not living at the bottom of the ocean or deep in a cave, day follows night, and the length of the day changes predictably throughout the year. These changes in photoperiod provide the most accurate signal for predicting upcoming seasonal conditions. Measuring day length allows plants and animals to anticipate and adapt to seasonal changes in their environments in order to optimally time key developmental events including seasonal growth and flowering of plants, annual bouts of reproduction, dormancy and migration in insects, and the collapse and regrowth of the reproductive system that drives breeding seasons in mammals and birds. Although research on photoperiodic time measurement originally integrated work on plants and animals, recent work has focused more narrowly and separately on plants, invertebrates, or vertebrates. As the fields have become more specialized there has been less interaction across the broader field of photoperiodism. As a result, researchers in each area often needlessly repeat both theoretical and experimental work. For example, understanding that there are genetically distinct morphs among species that, depending on latitude, respond to different critical photoperiods was discovered separately in plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates over the course of 20 years. However, over the past decade, intense work on daily and seasonal rhythms in fruit flies, mustard plants, and hamsters and mice, has led to remarkable progress in understanding the phenomenology, as well as the molecular and genetic mechanisms underlying circadian rhythms and clocks. This book was developed to further this type of cooperation among scientists from all related disciplines. It brings together leading researchers working on photoperiodic timing of seasonal adaptations in plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates. Each of its three sections begins with an introduction by the section editor, and at the end of the book, the section editors present a synthesis of common themes in photoperiodism, as well as discuss similarities and differences in approaches to the study of photoperiodism, and future directions for research on photoperiodic time measurement.},

abstract = {In 1847, Karl Bergmann proposed that temperature gradients are the key to understanding geographic variation in the body sizes of warm-blooded animals. Yet both the geographic patterns of body-size variation and their underlying mechanisms remain controversial. Here, we conduct the first assemblage-level global examination of 'Bergmann's rule' within an entire animal class. We generate global maps of avian body size and demonstrate a general pattern of larger body sizes at high latitudes, conforming to Bergmann's rule. We also show, however, that median body size within assemblages is systematically large on islands and small in species-rich areas. Similarly, while spatial models show that temperature is the single strongest environmental correlate of body size, there are secondary correlations with resource availability and a strong pattern of decreasing body size with increasing species richness. Finally, our results suggest that geographic patterns of body size are caused both by adaptation within lineages, as invoked by Bergmann, and by taxonomic turnover among lineages. Taken together, these results indicate that while Bergmann's prediction based on physiological scaling is remarkably accurate, it is far from the full picture. Global patterns of body size in avian assemblages are driven by interactions between the physiological demands of the environment, resource availability, species richness and taxonomic turnover among lineages.},

He very kindly presented me with the owl which, upon dissection, proved to be a female, its stomach containing a very considerable amount of bantam flesh and feathers, together with a great deal of wheat. (It seems probable that the wheat was accidentally swallowed with the crop of the bantam during the feast, but there was so much that it seems strange the owl did not discard it while eating). How a bird only 9.12 inches in length could have dealt out such havoc in so short a time is almost in-credible, but, 'although purely circumstantial, the evidence against the owl appeared altogether too strong for even a reasonable doubt. The doctor and I wished to make as certain as possible, however, so the poisoned bantam was replaced and left for several days, but without any further results.

To examine the influence of the solar compass during a highly familiar navigational task, 24 clock-shifted homing pigeons were precision-tracked from a release site close to and in sight of their final goal, the colony loft. The resulting trajectories displayed significant partial deflection from the loft direction as predicted by either fast or slow clock-shift treatments. The partial deflection was also found to be stable along the entire trajectory indicating regular updating of orientation via input from the solar compass throughout the final approach flight to the loft. Our results demonstrate that time-compensated solar cues are deeply embedded in the way birds orient during homing flight, are accessed throughout the journey and on a remarkably fine-grained scale, and may be combined effectively simultaneously with direct guidance from familiar landmarks, even when birds are flying towards a directly visible goal.},

abstract = {Aim: Current weaknesses of diversity theory include: a failure to distinguish different biogeographical response variables under the general heading of diversity; and a general failure of ecological theory to deal adequately with geographical scale. Our aim is to articulate the case for a top-down approach to theory building, in which scale is addressed explicitly and in which different response variables are clearly distinguished. Location: The article draws upon both theoretical contributions and empirical analyses from all latitudes, focusing on terrestrial ecosystems and with some bias towards (woody) plants. Methods: We review current diversity theory and terminology in relation to scale of applicability. As a starting point in developing a general theory, we take the issue of geographical gradients in species richness as a main theme and evaluate the extent to which commonly cited theories are likely to operate at scales from the macro down to the local. Results: A degree of confusion surrounds the use of the terms alpha, beta and gamma diversity, and the terms local, landscape and macro-scale are preferred here as a more intuitive framework. The distinction between inventory and differentiation diversity is highlighted as important as, in terms of scale of analysis, are the concepts of focus and extent. The importance of holding area constant in analysis is stressed, as is the notion that different environmental factors exhibit measurable heterogeneity at different scales. Evaluation of several of the most common diversity theories put forward for the grand dines in species richness, indicates that they can be collapsed to dynamic hypotheses based on climate or historical explanations. The importance of the many ecological/ biological mechanisms that have been proposed is evident mainly at local scales of analysis, whilst at the macro-scale they are dependent largely upon climatic controls for their operation. Local communities have often been found not to be saturated, i.e. to be non-equilibrial. This is argued, perhaps counter-intuitively, to be entirely compatible with the persistence through time of macro-scale patterns of richness that are climatically determined. The review also incorporates recent developments in macroecology, Rapoport's rule, trade-offs, and the importance of isolation, landscape impedance and geometric constraints on richness (the mid-domain effect) in generating richness patterns; highlighting those phenomena that are contributory to the first-order climatic pattern, and those, such as the geometric constraints, that may confound or obscure these patterns. Main conclusions: A general theory of diversity must necessarily cover many disparate phenomena, at various scales of analysis, and cannot therefore be expressed in a simple formula, but individual elements of this general theory may be. In particular, it appears possible to capture in a dynamic climate-based model and 'capacity rule', the form of the grand dine in richness of woody plants at the macro-scale. This provides a starting point for a top-down, global-to-local, macro-to-micro scale approach to modelling richness variations in a variety of taxa. Patterns in differentiation/endemicity, on the other hand, require more immediate attention to historical events, and to features of geography such as isolation. Thus, whilst we argue that there are basic physical principles and laws underlying certain diversity phenomena (e.g. macro-scale richness gradients), a plural- istic body of theory is required that incorporates dynamic and historical explanation, and which bridges equilibrial and nonequilibrial concepts and ideas.},

abstract = {The 24-hour rhythms of the circadian clock [1] allow an organism to anticipate daily environmental cycles, giving it a competitive advantage [2, 3]. Although clock components show little protein sequence homology across phyla, multiple feedback loops and light inputs are universal features of clock networks [4, 5]. Why have circadian systems evolved such a complex structure? All biological clocks entrain a set of regulatory genes to the environmental cycle, in order to correctly time the expression of many downstream processes. Thus the question becomes: What aspects of the environment, and of the desired downstream regulation, are demanding the observed complexity? To answer this, we have evolved gene regulatory networks in silico, selecting for networks that correctly predict particular phases of the day under light/dark cycles. Gradually increasing the realism of the environmental cycles, we have tested the networks for the minimal characteristics of clocks observed in nature: oscillation under constant conditions, entrainment to light signals, and the presence of multiple feedback loops and light inputs. Realistic circadian gene networks are found to require a nontrivial combination of conditions, with seasonal differences in photoperiod as a necessary but not sufficient component.},

abstract = {The identification of the sensory cues and mechanisms by which migratory birds are able to reach the same breeding and wintering grounds year after year has eluded biologists despite more than 50 years of intensive study. While a number of environmental cues have been proposed to play a role in the navigation of birds, arguments still persist about which cues are essential for the experience based navigation shown by adult migrants. To date, few studies have tested the sensory basis of navigational cues used during actual migration in the wild: mainly laboratory based studies or homing during the non-migratory season have been used to investigate this behaviour. Here we tested the role of olfactory and magnetic cues in the migration of the catbird (Dumetella carolinensis) by radio tracking the migration of birds with sensory manipulations during their actual migratory flights. Our data suggest that adult birds treated with zinc sulphate to produce anosmia were unable to show the same orientation as control adults, and instead reverted to a direction similar to that shown by juveniles making their first migration. The magnetic manipulation had no effect on the orientation of either adults or juveniles. These results allow us to propose that the olfactory sense may play a role in experience based migration in adult catbirds. While the olfactory sense has been shown to play a role in the homing of pigeons and other birds, this is the first time it has been implicated in migratory orientation.},

@article{Pennycuick2002,
abstract = {The classical theory of wind-gradient soaring requires an albatross to climb against the wind without losing air speed, relying on the increase in the wind strength as it climbs to offset the deceleration due to the climb. A simple calculation shows that a strong enough wind gradient could only be expected up to a height of about 3 m above the surface, in conditions where albatrosses typically pull up to around 15 m. Rather than extracting energy continuously from the wind gradient in a sustained climb, it is more effective to obtain pulses of energy at low level, by flying through regions of separated flow behind wave crests, out into the unobstruc- ted wind. Much more energy is extracted by receiving such a gust from the ventral side than from ahead. The typical behaviour of albatrosses is to roll belly-to-wind to a very steep angle of bank, as they pull up out of a separation bubble, when crossing a wave crest to windward. This manoeuvre delivers a pulse of kinetic energy corresponding to an ‘energy height', which is sufficient to account for the observed height of pullups. These were highest when stepping from wave to wave, down-swell. Alternatively, the energy can be used to penetrate into wind, close to the surface. Less energy height is available to smaller species from a gust of given strength, and their observed pullups were not so high as those of albatrosses. Manoeuvring in response to gusts would require fast and accurate monitoring of very small dynamic pressures, of the order of a few millimetres of water, calling for a sense organ more sensitive than any existing aircraft air speed indicator. It is suggested that the forward-poin- ting tubular nostrils of Procellariiformes (‘Tubinares') serve as pitot tubes, and that the large nasal sense organ is (at least in part) an organ that monitors dynamic pressure. The impli- cation is that only tube-nosed birds have the sensory ability to take advantage of the energy in gusts due to flow separation over wave crests. This is an unlimited source of energy, avail- able in abundance wherever winds of medium speed create the right surface conditions. Gan- nets and boobies do not have tubular nostrils, although they are otherwise quite similar mor- phologically to small albatrosses. Their flight is entirely different, relying heavily on flapping, with only a limited capacity for slope soaring along ocean swells (swell soaring). Their distri- bution is very restricted in comparison to that of petrels and albatrosses, which can roam free- ly anywhere over the oceans},

abstract = {Constructal theory is the view that (i) the generation of images of design (pattern, rhythm) in nature is a phenomenon of physics and (ii) this phenomenon is covered by a principle (the constructal law): 'for a finite-size flow system to persist in time (to live) it must evolve such that it provides greater and greater access to the currents that flow through it'. This law is about the necessity of design to occur, and about the time direction of the phenomenon: the tape of the design evolution 'movie' runs such that existing configurations are replaced by globally easier flowing configurations. The constructal law has two useful sides: the prediction of natural phenomena and the strategic engineering of novel architectures, based on the constructal law, i.e. not by mimicking nature. We show that the emergence of scaling laws in inanimate (geophysical) flow systems is the same phenomenon as the emergence of allometric laws in animate (biological) flow systems. Examples are lung design, animal locomotion, vegetation, river basins, turbulent flow structure, self-lubrication and natural multi-scale porous media. This article outlines the place of the constructal law as a self-standing law in physics, which covers all the ad hoc (and contradictory) statements of optimality such as minimum entropy generation, maximum entropy generation, minimum flow resistance, maximum flow resistance, minimum time, minimum weight, uniform maximum stresses and characteristic organ sizes.

The size-dependence of some variables works out to be different for animals of the same species as opposed to animals of different species. The reproductive rate, for instance, tends to increase with size for animals of the same species, but to decrease with size for animals of different species. This is because the parameter values are constants within a species, but vary in a size dependent manner for animals of different species. Although growth at constant food density is assumed to be of the von Bertalanffy type, and routine metabolism to be proportional to size, respiration turns out to be about proportional to size to the power 3/4, both within and between species. The value of about 3/4 has frequently been found, but it has always been thought to be incompatible with von Bertalanffy growth.},

abstract = {Upwelling of nutrient-rich, subsurface water sustains high productivity in the ocean's eastern boundary currents. These ecosystems support a rate of fish harvest nearly 100 times the global mean and account for {\textgreater}20{\%} of the world's marine fish catch. Environmental variability is thought to be the major cause of the decadal-scale biomass fluctuations characteristic of fish populations in these regions, but the mechanisms relating atmospheric physics to fish production remain unexplained. Two atmospheric conditions induce different types of upwelling in these ecosystems: coastal, alongshore wind stress, resulting in rapid upwelling (with high vertical velocity, w); and wind-stress curl, resulting in slower upwelling (low w). We show that the level of wind-stress curl has increased and that production of Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax) varies with wind-stress curl over the past six decades. The extent of isopycnal shoaling, nutricline depth, and chlorophyll concentration in the upper ocean also correlate positively with wind-stress curl. The size structure of plankton assemblages is related to the rate of wind-forced upwelling, and sardine feed efficiently on small plankters generated by slow upwelling. Upwelling rate is a fundamental determinant of the biological structure and production in coastal pelagic ecosystems, and future changes in the magnitude and spatial gradient of wind stress may have important and differing effects on these ecosystems. Understanding of the biological mechanisms relating fisheries production to environmental variability is essential for wise management of marine resources under a changing climate.},

abstract = {The decline of biodiversity with latitude has received great attention, but both the concise pattern and the causes of the gradient are under strong debate. Most studies of the latitudinal gradient comprise only one or few organism types and are often restricted to certain region or habitat types. To test for significant variation in the gradient between organisms, habitats, or regions, a meta-analysis was conducted on nearly 600 latitudinal gradients assembled from the literature. Each gradient was characterized by two effect sizes, strength (correlation coefficient) and slope, and additionally by 14 variables describing organisms, habitats, and regions. The analysis corroborated the high generality of the latitudinal diversity decline. Gradients on regional scales were significantly stronger and steeper than on local scales, and slopes also varied with sampling grain. Both strength and slope increased with organism body mass, and strength increased with trophic level. The body mass-effect size relation varied for ecto- versus homeotherm organisms and for different dispersal types, suggesting allometric effects on energy use and dispersal ability as possible mechanisms for the body mass effect. Latitudinal gradients were weaker and less steep in freshwater than in marine or terrestrial environments and differed significantly between continents and habitat types. The gradient parameters were not affected by hemisphere or the latitudinal range covered. This analysis is the first to describe these general and significant patterns, which have important consequences for models aiming to explain the latitudinal gradient.},

abstract = {Previous experiments have shown that a short, strong magnetic pulse caused migratory birds to change their headings from their normal migratory direction to an easterly direction in both spring and autumn. In order to analyse the nature of this pulse effect, we subjected migratory Australian silvereyes, Zosterops lateralis, to a magnetic pulse and tested their subsequent response under different magnetic conditions. In the local geomagnetic field, the birds preferred easterly headings as before, and when the horizontal component of the magnetic field was shifted 90 degrees anticlockwise, they altered their headings accordingly northwards. In a field with the vertical component inverted, the birds reversed their headings to westwards, indicating that their directional orientation was controlled by the normal inclination compass. These findings show that although the pulse strongly affects the magnetite particles, it leaves the functional mechanism of the magnetic compass intact. Thus, magnetite-based receptors seem to mediate magnetic 'map'-information used to determine position, and when affected by a pulse, they provide birds with false positional information that causes them to change their course.},

abstract = {Most birds use at least two modes of locomotion: flying and walking (terrestrial locomotion). Whereas the wings and tail are used for flying, the legs are mainly used for walking. The role of other body segments remains, however, poorly understood. In this study, we examine the kinematics of the head, the trunk, and the legs during terrestrial locomotion in the quail (Coturnix coturnix). Despite the trunk representing about 70{\%} of the total body mass, its function in locomotion has received little scientific interest to date. This prompted us to focus on its role in terrestrial locomotion. We used high-speed video fluoroscopic recordings of quails walking at voluntary speeds on a trackway. Dorso-ventral and lateral views of the motion of the skeletal elements were recorded successively and reconstructed in three dimensions using a novel method based on the temporal synchronisation of both views. An analysis of the trajectories of the body parts and their coordination showed that the trunk plays an important role during walking. Moreover, two sub-systems participate in the gait kinematics: (i) the integrated 3D motion of the trunk and thighs allows for the adjustment of the path of the centre of mass; (ii) the motion of distal limbs transforms the alternating forward motion of the feet into a continuous forward motion at the knee and thus assures propulsion. Finally, head bobbing appears qualitatively synchronised to the movements of the trunk. An important role for the thigh muscles in generating the 3D motion of the trunk is suggested by an analysis of the pelvic anatomy.},

abstract = {The constructal law is the statement that for a flow system to persist in time it must evolve in such a way that it provides easier access to its currents. This is the law of configuration generation, or the law of design. The theoretical developments reviewed in this article show that this law accounts for (i) architectures that maximize flow access (e.g. trees), (ii) features that impede flow (e.g. impermeable walls, insulation) and (iii) static organs that support flow structures. The proportionality between body heat loss and body size raised to the power 3/4 is deduced from the discovery that the counterflow of two trees is the optimal configuration for achieving (i) and (ii) simultaneously: maximum fluid-flow access and minimum heat leak. Other allometric examples deduced from the constructal law are the flying speeds of insects, birds and aeroplanes, the porosity and hair strand diameter of the fur coats of animals, and the existence of optimal organ sizes. Body size and configuration are intrinsic parts of the deduced configuration. They are results, not assumptions. The constructal law extends physics (thermodynamics) to cover the configuration, performance, global size and global internal flow volume of flow systems. The time evolution of such configurations can be described as survival by increasing performance, compactness and territory.},

Here, we investigated repeated migratory journeys of a long-distance migrating bird, the marsh harrier Circus aeruginosus, in order to analyse the variation within and between individuals with respect to routes and timing. We found that there was a stronger individual repeatability in time than in space. Thus, the annual timing of migration varied much less between repeated journeys of the same individual than between different individuals, while there was considerable variation in the routes of the same individual on repeated journeys. The overall contrast in repeatability between time and space was unexpected and may be owing to strong endogenous control of timing, while short-term variation in environmental conditions (weather and habitat) might promote route flexibility. The individual variation in migration routes indicates that the birds navigate mainly by other means than detailed route recapitulation based on landmark recognition.},

I argue that it is useful to define Grinnellian and Eltonian niches on the basis of the types of variables used to calculate them, the natural spatial scale at which they can be measured, and the dispersal of the individuals over the environment. I use set theory notation and analogies derived from population ecology theory to obtain formal definitions of areas of distribution and several types of niches.

abstract = {For organisms that fly or swim, movement results from the combined effects of the moving medium - air or water - and the organism's own locomotion. For larger organisms, propulsion contributes significantly to progress but the flow usually still provides significant opposition or assistance, or produces lateral displacement ('drift'). Animals show a range of responses to flows, depending on the direction of the flow relative to their preferred direction, the speed of the flow relative to their own self-propelled speed, the incidence of flows in different directions and the proportion of the journey remaining. We here present a classification of responses based on the direction of the resulting movement relative to flow and preferred direction, which is applicable to a range of taxa and environments. The responses adopted in particular circumstances are related to the organisms' locomotory and sensory capacities and the environmental cues available. Advances in biologging technologies and particle tracking models are now providing a wealth of data, which often demonstrate a striking level of convergence in the strategies that very different animals living in very different environments employ when moving in a flow. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Knots Calidris canutus live highly seasonal lives, breeding solitarily on high arctic tundra and spending the non-breeding season in large social flocks in temperate to tropical estuaries. Their reproductive activities and physiological preparations for long flights are reflected in pronounced plumage and body mass changes, even in long-term captives of the islandica subspecies (breeding in north Greenland and northeast Canada and wintering in western Europe) studied in outdoor aviaries. The three to four fattening episodes in April-July in connection with the flights to and from the high arctic breeding grounds by free-living birds, are represented by a single period of high body mass, peaking between late May and early July in a sample of ten captive islandica knots studied over four years. There are consistent and synchronized annual variations in basal metabolic rate and thermal conductance in three islandica knots. Basal metabolic rate was highest during the summer body mass peak. Within the examined individuals, basal metabolic rate scales on body mass with an exponent of about 1.4, probably reflecting a general hypertrophy of metabolically expensive muscles and organs. Any potential effect of moult on basal metabolic rate was obscured by the large seasonal mass-associated variations. In breeding plumage, insulation (the inverse of thermal conductance) was a factor of 1.35 lower than in winter plumage. This was paralleled by the dry mass of contour feathers being a factor of 1.17 lower. In this subspecies the breeding season is indeed the period during which the costs of thermoregulation are lowest. In captive knots seasonal changes in basal metabolic rate and thermal conductance likely reflect an anticipatory programme adaptive to the variable demands made by the environment at different times of the year.},

@article{Pennycuick2003,
abstract = {The distance flown in gliding is proportional to the starting height, not to the starting potential energy, and it is independent of the body mass. By analogy, in powered flight, the quantity of stored fuel can be converted into a virtual "fuel energy height", defined as the height to which the fuel energy could lift the bird against gravity, if it were converted into work. This is a logarithmic function of the fuel fraction, not of the absolute amount of fuel, or of the body mass. It takes account of the strength of gravity, and of the efficiency with which fuel energy is converted into work. The "performance number" is the gradient on which a migrating bird comes "down" from its initial fuel energy height. It is mechanical (not physiological) in character, and corresponds to the lift:drag ratio in a fixed-wing aircraft. The concept of range as an initial energy height multiplied by a performance number can also be applied to swimming and running animals. Performance number, and also the related variable "cost of transport", are both independent of gravity in flying and running, but not in swimming. Migration by thermal soaring is analogous to powered flight with stopovers, except that the bird replenishes its potential energy by climbing in thermals, rather than replenishing fuel energy during stopovers. Rates of climb in thermals are typically higher than fuel energy rates of climb, but the available height band is two orders of magnitude smaller, and the intervals at which energy replenishment is needed are correspondingly shorter. Albatrosses replenish their kinetic energy by exploiting discontinuities in the wind flow over waves, requiring replenishment at intervals of tens of seconds, a further two orders of magnitude shorter than in thermal soaring. Fat energy height can be used as a measure of "condition", which is independent of the size or type of the animal. The fat energy height at which a migrant must arrive on the breeding grounds, in order to breed successfully, reflects the ecological characteristics of the habitat, not the size or character of the bird. Energy height expresses what an animal or machine can do with its stored energy, not the amount of energy. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Westerly winds in the Southern Ocean have increased in intensity and moved poleward. Using long-term demographic and foraging records, we show that foraging range in wandering albatrosses has shifted poleward in conjunction with these changes in wind pattern, while their rates of travel and flight speeds have increased. Consequently, the duration of foraging trips has decreased, breeding success has improved, and birds have increased in mass by more than 1 kilogram. These positive consequences of climate change may be temporary if patterns of wind in the southern westerlies follow predicted climate change scenarios. This study stresses the importance of foraging performance as the key link between environmental changes and population processes.},

abstract = {Many soaring bird species migrate southwards in autumn from their breeding grounds in Europe and Central Asia towards their wintering grounds. Our knowledge about interactions between migrating birds, thermal selection during migration and mechanisms that lead to flocking or convergent travel networks is still very limited. To start investigating these aspects we developed an individual-based simulation model that describes the local interactions between birds and their environment during their migratory flight, leading to emergent patterns at larger scales. The aim of our model is to identify likely decision rules with respect to thermal selection and navigation. After explaining the model, it is applied to analyse the migration of white storks (Ciconia ciconia) over part of its migration domain. A model base-run is accompanied by a sensitivity analysis. It appears that social interactions lead to the use of fewer thermals and slight increases in distance travelled. Possibilities for different model extensions and further model application are discussed.},

@article{Bishop2005,
abstract = {When considering the 'burst' flight performance of birds, such as during take-off, one of the most important structural variables is the ratio of the mass of the flight muscle myofibrils with respect to body mass. However, when considering 'prolonged' flight performance the variable of interest should be the body mass ratio of the mass of the flight muscle myofibrils that can be perfused sustainably with metabolites via the blood supply. The latter variable should be related to blood flow (ml min(-1)), which in turn has been shown to be a function of heart muscle mass, the value of which is more easily obtainable for different species than that for the mass of perfused muscle. The limited empirical evidence available suggests that for birds and mammals the rate of maximum oxygen consumption scales with heart mass (Mh) as Mh 0.88 and that for birds Mh scales with body mass (Mb) as Mb 0.92, leading to the conclusion that the rate of maximum oxygen consumption in birds scales with an exponent of around Mb 0.82. A similar exponent would be expected for the rate of maximum oxygen consumption with respect to the flight muscle mass of birds. This suggests that the sustainable power output from the flight muscles may ultimately be limiting the flight performance of very large flying animals, but as a result of circulatory constraints rather than biomechanical considerations of the flight muscles per se. Under the particular circumstances of sustainable flight performance, calculations of rates of metabolic energy consumed by the flight muscles can be compared directly with the estimates of biomechanical power output required, as calculated using various aerodynamic models. The difference between these calculated values for rates of energy input and output from the muscles is equivalent to the 'apparent' mechanochemical conversion efficiency. The results of one such analysis, of the maximum sustainable flight performance of migratory birds, leads to the conclusion that the efficiency of the flight muscles appears to scale as Mb 0.14. However, much of this apparent scaling may be an artefact of the application and assumptions of the models. The resolution of this issue is only likely to come from studying bird species at either extreme of the size range.},

abstract = {Many studies in recent years have investigated the effects of climate change on the future of biodiversity. In this review, we first examine the different possible effects of climate change that can operate at individual, population, species, community, ecosystem and biome scales, notably showing that species can respond to climate change challenges by shifting their climatic niche along three non-exclusive axes: time (e.g. phenology), space (e.g. range) and self (e.g. physiology). Then, we present the principal specificities and caveats of the most common approaches used to estimate future biodiversity at global and sub-continental scales and we synthesise their results. Finally, we highlight several challenges for future research both in theoretical and applied realms. Overall, our review shows that current estimates are very variable, depending on the method, taxonomic group, biodiversity loss metrics, spatial scales and time periods considered. Yet, the majority of models indicate alarming consequences for biodiversity, with the worst-case scenarios leading to extinction rates that would qualify as the sixth mass extinction in the history of the earth.},

@article{Pennycuick1998,
abstract = {The mechanical power required from a bird's flight muscles was recalculated at regular intervals (default 6 min), and the energy consumed in the interval was accounted for by reducing fuel reserves, which also reduced the all-up mass and the body cross-sectional area. Part of the energy requirement was met by consuming flight muscle tissue, according to one of three alternative "muscle burn criteria". These were (1) specific work held constant, (2) power density held constant and (3) muscle mass held constant, i.e. no muscle consumed. Holding the specific work constant produced results in the best agreement with the results of other studies. This criterion was therefore selected to compare simulated flights of three very different species whose flight and migrations have been extensively studied, (1) Thrush Nightingale (Luscinia luscinia), (2) Knot (Calidris canutus) and (3) Whooper Swan (Cygnus cygnus). The ratio of protein to fat consumed ranged from 0.19 to 0.36, depending mainly on the starting value assumed for the muscle fraction. Specific work and starting power density were much higher for the Whooper Swan than for the two smaller species, suggesting that the latter have power to spare for climbing to high cruising altitudes, whereas the swan has not. If all three species were able to reach high cruising altitudes, the result would be a large reduction in journey time, which in turn would result in a small increase in range, due to a saving of energy required for basal metabolism. On current assumptions, the proportion of the fuel energy spent on basal metabolism would be eight times higher in the Thrush Nightingale than in the Whooper Swan, consequently the gain in range due to flying high would be greater in the smaller bird. In order to run the simulation, assumptions have been made at the primary physical level, to calculate the mechanical power required, and also at the secondary physiological level, to convert this into fuel consumption. The physical assumptions mostly take the form of variables whose existence is not in doubt, but whose values are poorly known, whereas in the case of some of the most important physiological variables, even the principles are unknown. Attention is drawn to a number of problems in need of attention, including (1) the mass and energy requirements of respiratory and circulatory organs required to sustain aerobically a given level of mechanical power; (2) the capabilities of bird lungs at high altitudes; (3) the possibility that heart muscle and lung tissue may be consumed in flight; (4) the two "biological constants", isometric force per myosin fibril and inverse power density of mitochondria; (5) the energy density of different fuels, and the conversion efficiency of the flight muscles; and (6) the manner in which basal metabolism combines with other demands for power in an exercising animal.

abstract = {Various experimental studies carried out over the last 30-40 years have examined the effects of the chronic or acute exposure of laboratory animals to static magnetic fields. Many of the earlier studies have been adequately reviewed elsewhere; few adverse effects were identified. This review focuses on studies carried out more recently, mostly those using vertebrates, particularly mammals. Four main areas of investigation have been covered, viz., nervous system and behavioural studies, cardiovascular system responses, reproduction and development, and genotoxicity and cancer. Work on the role of the natural geomagnetic field in animal orientation and migration has been omitted. Generally, the acute responses found during exposure to static fields above about 4 T are consistent with those found in volunteer studies, namely the induction of flow potentials around the heart and the development of aversive/avoidance behaviour resulting from body movement in such fields. No consistently demonstrable effects of exposure to fields of approximately 1T and above have been seen on other behavioural or cardiovascular endpoints. In addition, no adverse effects of such fields on reproduction and development or on the growth and development of tumours have been firmly established. Overall, however, far too few animal studies have been carried out to reach any firm conclusions.},

abstract = {It is proposed that the avian magnetic compass depends on the angle between the horizontal component B(h) of the geomagnetic field (GMF) and E(r), the radial electric field distribution generated by gamma-oscillations within the optic tectum (TeO). We hypothesize that the orientation of the brain relative to B(h) is perceived as a set of electric field ion cyclotron resonance (ICR) frequencies that are distributed in spatially recognizeable regions within the TeO. For typical GMF intensities, the expected ICR frequencies fall within the 20-50 Hz range of gamma-oscillation frequencies observed during visual stimulation. The model builds on the fact that the superficial lamina of the TeO receive signals from the retina that spatially map the visual field. The ICR frequencies are recruited from the local wide-band gamma-oscillations and are superposed on the tectum for interpretation along with other sensory data. As a first approximation, our analysis is restricted to the medial horizontal plane of the TeO. For the bird to fly in a preferred, previously mapped direction relative to B(h), it hunts for that orientation that positions the frequency maxima at appropriate locations on the TeO. This condition can be maintained even as B(h) varies with geomagnetic latitude during the course of long-distance flights. The magnetovisual coordinate system (straight phi, omega) overlaying the two halves of the tectal surface in a nonsymmetric way may imply an additional orienting function for the TeO over and above that of a simple compass (e.g., homing navigation as distinct from migrational navigation).},
