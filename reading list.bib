abstract = {The 24-hour rhythms of the circadian clock [1] allow an organism to anticipate daily environmental cycles, giving it a competitive advantage [2, 3]. Although clock components show little protein sequence homology across phyla, multiple feedback loops and light inputs are universal features of clock networks [4, 5]. Why have circadian systems evolved such a complex structure? All biological clocks entrain a set of regulatory genes to the environmental cycle, in order to correctly time the expression of many downstream processes. Thus the question becomes: What aspects of the environment, and of the desired downstream regulation, are demanding the observed complexity? To answer this, we have evolved gene regulatory networks in silico, selecting for networks that correctly predict particular phases of the day under light/dark cycles. Gradually increasing the realism of the environmental cycles, we have tested the networks for the minimal characteristics of clocks observed in nature: oscillation under constant conditions, entrainment to light signals, and the presence of multiple feedback loops and light inputs. Realistic circadian gene networks are found to require a nontrivial combination of conditions, with seasonal differences in photoperiod as a necessary but not sufficient component.},

Next morning the seemingly im-possible was made a practical certainty, for he found the body of a screech owl with the claws of one foot firmly imbedded in the body of the bantam. He very kindly presented me with the owl which, upon dissection, proved to be a female, its stomach containing a very considerable amount of bantam flesh and feathers, together with a great deal of wheat. (It seems probable that the wheat was accidentally swallowed with the crop of the bantam during the feast, but there was so much that it seems strange the owl did not discard it while eating). How a bird only 9.12 inches in length could have dealt out such havoc in so short a time is almost in-credible, but, 'although purely circumstantial, the evidence against the owl appeared altogether too strong for even a reasonable doubt. The doctor and I wished to make as certain as possible, however, so the poisoned bantam was replaced and left for several days, but without any further results. For the above mentioned reasons I am rather doubtful as to the net value of this owl from an economic standpoint, although birds in a wild state would not give them such opportunities for such wanton killing as birds enclosed in pens. THE California Thrasher (Tozostoma redivivum) is one of the several distinct bird types which characterize the so-called "Cali-fornian Fauna." Its range is notably restricted, even more so than that of the Wren-Tit. Only at the south does the California Thrasher occur beyond the limits of the state of California, and in that direction only as far as the San Pedro Martir Mountains and 1 Contribution from the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology of the University of California.},

abstract = {Migratory birds are known to be able to navigate — to determine their position on the globe and the direction towards their distant goal even if they cannot perceive any information emanating from the goal. One hypothesis, that of true bi-coordinate navigation, claims that birds should be able to sense and use a grid of two natural parameters as coordinates. Some indirect data support the idea that migratory birds can determine their north-south position, and several recent studies have suggested that at least long-distance migrants, including the Eurasian Reed Warbler, Acrocephalus scirpaceus, can determine their east-west position. How they do this remains a mystery. Birds could theoretically detect the magnitude of east-west displacements if they have two clocks, one synchronizing faster to local time than the other. We tested whether this putative “double clock” mechanism may serve as a navigational tool for detecting east-west position. We caught Eurasian Reed Warblers during spring migration and tested their orientation in Emlen funnels under capture site photoperiodic conditions. After these northeasterly oriented control tests, we exposed them to a light-dark regime simulating a 1,000 km eastward displacement to the Moscow region from where we have shown that actually displaced Eurasian Reed Warblers on spring migration compensate for their displacement by orientating northwestwardly. Exposure to the Moscow light-dark regime did not affect the birds' orientation. Our results suggest that light-dark regime effects alone are unlikely to trigger compensation for the longitudinal displacement in long-distance migratory Eurasian Reed Warblers.},

abstract = {Phenology refers to the periodic appearance of life-cycle events and currently receives abundant attention as the effects of global change on phenology are so apparent. Phenology as a discipline observes these events and relates their annual variation to variation in climate. But phenology is also studied in other disciplines, each with their own perspective. Evolutionary ecologists study variation in seasonal timing and its fitness consequences, whereas chronobiologists emphasize the periodic nature of life-cycle stages and their underlying timing programmes (e.g. circannual rhythms). The (neuro-) endocrine processes underlying these life-cycle events are studied by physiologists and need to be linked to genes that are explored by molecular geneticists. In order to fully understand variation in phenology, we need to integrate these different perspectives, in particular by combining evolutionary and mechanistic approaches. We use avian research to characterize different perspectives and to highlight integration that has already been achieved. Building on this work, we outline a route towards uniting the different disciplines in a single framework, which may be used to better understand and, more importantly, to forecast climate change impacts on phenology.},
annote = {Intro







- some species show extreme reliability in year-to-year phenology (i.e. birds) while others show great variation between years. 
- temperate zone, temperature usually the best predictor of phenology.
- needed -- ability to predict phenology shifts well outside the current projected range of observed data to address climate change. Hence, we need a unified framework that incorporates an ecological and evolutionary prospective. 
- look up -- cirannual thythms.







Different Perspectives







-Phenologists -- record life-cycle events over long periods of time and relate the inter-annual variations to climatic variables.
- focus on seasonal recurrence in its own right.
- focus on first individuals or population mean rather than variation among individuals of the population.
- Individual approach -- The date that something happens is a phenotype and should be treated accordingly.
- variation in date will be the result of phenotypic plastisity and is this shaped by the interaction between the genotype and the environment.
- Evolutionary ecologist -- refer to it as "seasonal timing." Emphasize variation among individuals within years and between years. 
- "birds have been selected for their ability to have their chicks in the nest at the time of peak food abundance." -- I think the link to evolution is correct, but I don't think it has as much to do with food as it does with temperature. 
- have birds evoloved the ability to CORRECTLY interpret proximate cues (interpreted well before the actual breeding event) to hit a particular optimal date?
- cues should provide the ability to predict the future environment under which the phenotype will be selected. Including: conspecific and multi-trophic interactions. 
- these cues must actually be a suite of cues on a multi-dimensional enivronmental axis. 
- Mainly study organisms in the wild to observe fitness benifits and selection events on timing.
- Physiologists -- how do the changes within annual cycles causally come about? How can environmental cues adjust morphology, physiology, and behaviour over an annual schedule?
- strong emphasis on photoperiod. 
- hypothalamo-pituitary-honadal (HPG) axis is the well studied mechanism for translating photoperiod cues to behavioral action in birds.
- shown that temp, social, moisture, and food availability cues are also important, but the mechanism for translation is not as well known as the HPG axis.
- most of this work is done at the individual behavioral level, in a lab.
- test usually conducted under controlled temp (usually warmer than natural conditions and constant) with a heavy bias toward males rather than females (because females usually don't reach full reproductive maturity in captivity). 
- one useful proxy used in field experiments is gonadal development rather than actual egg laying. 
- Chronobiologist -- focus on internal timing programmes that enable organisms to cope with, and anticipate, geophysical cycles in the enivronment.
- this is the internal clock that persists even without external cues. 
-work on daily or yearly cycles
- seperate period (length of cycle) from phase (time when that cycle occurs). 
- less interested in variation between years or individuals 
- focus on avvual cycle and variation over the year.
- events occur based on the interplay between internal time-structuring and environmental cues. 
- seasonal clock determines how sensitive an animal is to external cues. The individual will respond to cues during some times of the year and not others. 
- for birds -- the circadian clock internally references 24 hours for the bird to compare the photoperiod to, to determine if a day is "long" (larger proportion of 24) or "short" (smaller proportion of 24). 
- If the bird is in the correct phase for photostimulation, a cascade of gene expression starts. 
- includes citations for comparisons of this process between different taxa. 
- Molecular Geneticist -- what are the genes controlling timing and how do those genes vary between individuals.
- have shown that a latitudinal gradient exists in the mean repeat lenght (more repeats at hight lats) exists in the one known candidate gene for timing. 
- females with shorter repeat lengths layed eggs earlier. 
- these studies completely absent in wild birds. 
- OTL studies are monitoring gene expression to try to find the genes controlling these cycles. Looking at both the genes that do the work and the genes that set that work into motion. 







Integration toward a single framework







- evolution is the primary controlling force. phenotype controlled by selection.
-relatively small changes in reproduction date have large fitness consequences. 
-because fitness consequences depend on a species' ecology, and the particular environment, "there is no single mechanism that fits all species."
-- I don't think this is exactly true... I'm trying to define the environment 
within with species or individual 
compete and set their date.
-a crucial step is taking account of variation between species or populations, as well as between individuals with a population. 
- 



















































animals must use cues to predict selection



















































. 
- so, the animal will use a cue that predicts indirect effects. i.e. precip -{\textgreater} grass -{\textgreater} food source.
- quails require a combined reduction in temperature and photoperiod to stop reproduction entirely. 
- the same temperature can have a stronger effect on a species during longer photoperiod than shorter photoperiod. 
- in very long photoperiods, individuals can breed under very low abient temperatures. 
- if things go wrong and you lay out of optimal zone or a severe weather event takes place, then individuals may switch to an emergency life-history stage. 
- phenotypic reaction norm -- a distribution where the breadth determines how broadly selection can act on a trait and the hight determines how strongly selection can act on a trait. 
- selection can not act on the translation and response to cues, not on date itself. probably also works on a suite of traits rather than a specific one.
-- similarities to spatial movement. 
We sense our location based on cues, 
not the location itself.
- the cues do not happen in the same environment as the reproduction. Again, prediction. 
- 














only if the environment of selection is predicted by an environmental variable can it serve as a predictive cue














. 








- Blue tit case study.








- Outlook -- where to go from here.
- climate change is effecting phenology, but how and why?
- If climate change affets the environmental variables that serve as cues differently from the from the environmental variables that form the environment at the time of selection, then the response to climate change will no longer be adaptive. Cues lose their predictive value. 
- for things to survive climate change, their phenotypic plasticity must be greater than the change in the environment.
- does learning play a role over the lifetime of individuals? probably...},

abstract = {Understanding of the determinants of species' geographic range limits remains poorly integrated. In part, this is because of the diversity of perspectives on the issue, and because empirical studies have lagged substantially behind developments in theory. Here, I provide a broad overview, drawing together many of the disparate threads, considering, in turn, how influences on the terms of a simple single-population equation can determine range limits. There is theoretical and empirical evidence for systematic changes towards range limits under some circumstances in each of the demographic parameters. However, under other circumstances, no such changes may take place in particular parameters, or they may occur in a different direction, with limitation still occurring. This suggests that (i) little about range limitation can categorically be inferred from many empirical studies, which document change in only one demographic parameter, (ii) there is a need for studies that document variation in all of the parameters, and (iii) in agreement with theoretical evidence that range limits can be formed in the presence or absence of hard boundaries, environmental gradients or biotic interactions, there may be few general patterns as to the determinants of these limits, with most claimed generalities at least having many exceptions.},

abstract = {Understanding the mechanisms that drive specialization and speciation within initially homogeneous populations is a fundamental challenge for evolutionary theory. It is an issue of relevance for significant open questions in biology concerning the generation and maintenance of biodiversity, the origins of reciprocal cooperation, and the efficient division of labor in social or colonial organisms. Several mathematical frameworks have been developed to address this question and models based on evolutionary game theory or the adaptive dynamics of phenotypic mutation have demonstrated the emergence of polymorphic, specialized populations. Here we focus on a ubiquitous biological phenomenon, migration. Individuals in our model may evolve the capacity to detect and follow an environmental cue that indicates a preferred migration route. The strategy space is defined by the level of investment in acquiring personal information about this route or the alternative tendency to follow the direction choice of others. The result is a relation between the migratory process and a game theoretic dynamic that is generally applicable to situations where information may be considered a public good. Through the use of an approximation of social interactions, we demonstrate the emergence of a stable, polymorphic population consisting of an uninformed subpopulation that is dependent upon a specialized group of leaders. The branching process is classified using the techniques of adaptive dynamics.},

@article{Jenni2003c,
abstract = {As a response to increasing spring temperature in temperate regions in recent years, populations of many plant and animal species, including migratory birds, have advanced the seasonal start of their reproduction or growth. However, the effects of climate changes on subsequent events of the annual cycle remain poorly understood. We investigated long-term changes in the timing of autumn migration in birds, a key event in the annual cycle limiting the reproductive period. Using data spanning a 42-year period, we analysed long-term changes in the passage of 65 species of migratory birds through Western Europe. The autumn passage of migrants wintering south of the Sahara has advanced in recent years, presumably as a result of selection pressure to cross the Sahel before its seasonal dry period. In contrast, migrants wintering north of the Sahara have delayed autumn passage. In addition, species with a variable rather than a fixed number of broods per year have delayed passage, possibly because they are free to attempt more broods. Recent climate changes seem to have a simple unidirectional effect on the seasonal onset of reproduction, but complex and opposing effects on the timing of subsequent events in the annual cycle, depending on the ecology and life history of a species. This complicates predictions of overall effects of global warming on avian communities.},

abstract = {Electronic tracking tags have revolutionized our understanding of broad-scale movements and habitat use of highly mobile marine animals, but a large gap in our knowledge still remains for a wide range of small species. Here, we report the extraordinary transequatorial postbreeding migrations of a small seabird, the sooty shearwater, obtained with miniature archival tags that log data for estimating position, dive depth, and ambient temperature. Tracks (262+/-23 days) reveal that shearwaters fly across the entire Pacific Ocean in a figure-eight pattern while traveling 64,037+/-9,779 km roundtrip, the longest animal migration ever recorded electronically. Each shearwater made a prolonged stopover in one of three discrete regions off Japan, Alaska, or California before returning to New Zealand through a relatively narrow corridor in the central Pacific Ocean. Transit rates as high as 910+/-186 km.day-1 were recorded, and shearwaters accessed prey resources in both the Northern and Southern Hemisphere's most productive waters from the surface to 68.2 m depth. Our results indicate that sooty shearwaters integrate oceanic resources throughout the Pacific Basin on a yearly scale. Sooty shearwater populations today are declining, and because they operate on a global scale, they may serve as an important indicator of climate change and ocean health.},
