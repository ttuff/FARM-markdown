@article{Perfito2005,
abstract = {Day length predicts changing of seasons at mid-latitudes, but additional environmental cues (e.g., temperature, rainfall) give more precise information about timing of food peaks critical for offspring survival. We tested the effects of temperature on seasonal reproductive development of male song sparrows (Melospiza melodia morphna) from two populations: the Western Washington coast (3 m) and Cascade Mountains (500-1220 m). Previous work has shown that the timing of gonadal recrudescence can differ between the two sites in the field by as much as two months. However, in the laboratory under identical controlled conditions, testes grow at the same rate. To test whether temperature alone could account for a portion of the variation we measured in the field, we captured birds from each site and held them in temperature controlled environmental chambers that mimicked temperatures experienced either in the mountains or on the coast. We increased day length on a natural schedule, and measured testis volume, levels of circulating androgens and prolactin, and song rates. Increasing day length stimulated gonadal growth in all groups. We found only modest effects of temperature on reproductive development. In the mountain birds colder, montane temperatures slowed rates of growth, delaying the onset of growth by one month. Since temperature changes more markedly during the early winter months in the mountains than on the coast, increasing temperature may be a more relevant cue in timing of reproduction in the mountain population. These data suggest that while temperature helps to explain some of the variation in reproductive timing of free living sparrows, another as yet untested cue in the field may play a more important role. Furthermore, our data suggest that individuals within the same species may rely on different proximate cues for reproductive timing depending on the specific habitat in which they live.},

abstract = {The absence of adaptive host responses to virulent parasites and pathogens is paradoxical. We explored the theoretical possibility that the evolution of antiparasitic egg-ejection strategies was delayed by avian hosts' lifetime experiences with brood parasitism. An analytical model indicated that individual hosts' repeated exposure to parasitism decreased the relative benefits of learning-based rejecter strategies when parasitism was particularly costly. Because brood parasitic brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater) and their hosts are typically philopatric across breeding attempts, spatially and temporally non-random patterns of parasitism may contribute to low levels of observed egg-ejection by vulnerable cowbird hosts. In support, we found that in three populations of two host species individual females experienced repeated cowbird parasitism during their lifetimes. We propose that repeated parasitism contributes to counterintuitive patterns of coevolutionary dynamics in spatially structured host-parasite populations.},

abstract = {Captive male brown-headed cowbirds exposed to long days exhibit gonadal growth and have elevated plasma testosterone (T) levels. This photoperiodic response is enhanced if males are housed with female cowbirds: Photostimulated males with females increase plasma testosterone levels sooner than do individually housed photostimulated males. Peak plasma T levels are similar in both groups, although peak levels are maintained longer in males housed with females. The gonadal cycle is similarly affected; males in the presence of females have earlier gonadal recrudescence and maintain mature gonads longer than do photostimulated males without females. Plasma corticosterone levels increase in the unpaired males, suggesting that removal of social cues is stressful for these birds. Free-living paired males have significantly higher plasma testosterone levels than do unpaired/unknown males early in the season, when social relationships are being established; the levels are similar thereafter. There is no difference between the two groups in testicular maturation rates; nor do they differ in plasma corticosterone levels at any time of the season. These results suggest that social stimuli are important in modulating the secretion of testosterone in males early in the season when pairing occurs, and possibly late in the season as well, probably to prevent termination of breeding prior to that of females.},

@article{Tuero2012,
abstract = {Interspecific brood parasites, like the shiny cowbird (Molothrus bonariensis), lay eggs in nests of other species. Shiny cowbird females peck and puncture eggs when they parasitize host nests. This behavior increases the survival of cowbird chicks when they have to compete for food with larger nestmates. However, cowbird chicks may benefit from smaller nestmates as they increase food provisioning by parents and the cowbird chicks secure most extra provisioning. We investigated whether egg-pecking behavior by female shiny cowbirds might be adjusted to the competition that their chicks face in host nests. We found that more host eggs are destroyed per cowbird egg laid in a larger-bodied host (chalk-browed mockingbird, Mimus saturninus, 70-75 g) than a smaller-bodied host (house wrens, Troglodytes aedon, 12-13 g). We also tested egg-pecking preferences in choice experiments with female cowbirds in captivity and found cowbirds presented with eggs in artificial nests pecked first and more frequently, and punctured more frequently the larger egg when this was a host egg, but not when this was a cowbird egg. Our results are partially consistent with the hypothesis that shiny cowbird females adaptively adjust their egg pecking behavior according to the competition that their chicks face in host nests.},
