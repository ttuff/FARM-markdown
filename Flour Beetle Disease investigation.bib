abstract = {The high prevalence of meiotic recombination-an important element of sexual reproduction-represents one of the greatest puzzles in biology. The influence of either selection by a co-evolving parasite alone or in combination with genetic drift on recombination rates was tested in the host-parasite system Tribolium castaneum and Nosema whitei. After eight generations, populations with smaller genetic drift had a lower recombination rate than those with high drift whereas parasites had no effect. Interestingly, changes in recombination rate at one site of the chromosome negatively correlated with changes at the adjacent site on the same chromosome indicating an occurrence of crossover interference. The occurrence of spontaneous or plastic changes in recombination rates could be excluded with a separate experiment.},

abstract = {Information on the molecular basis of resistance and the evolution of resistance is crucial to an understanding of the appearance, spread, and distribution of resistance genes and of the mechanisms of host adaptation in natural populations. One potential important genetic constraint for the evolution of resistance is fitness cost associated with resistance. To determine whether host resistance to parasite infection is associated with fitness costs, we conducted simultaneous quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping of resistance to parasite infection and fitness traits using the red flour beetle (Tribolium castaneum) and the tapeworm parasite (Hymenolepis diminuta) system in two independent segregating populations. A genome-wide QTL scan using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers revealed three QTL for beetle resistance to tapeworm infection. These three QTL account for 44-58{\%} variance in beetle infection intensity. We identified five QTL for fecundity and five QTL for egg-to-adult viability, which accounted for 36-57{\%} and 36-49{\%}, respectively, of the phenotypic variance in fecundity and egg-to-adult viability. The three QTL conferring resistance were colocalized with the QTL affecting beetle fitness. The genome regions that contain the QTL for parasite resistance explained the majority of the variance in fecundity and egg-to-adult viability in the mapping populations. Colocalization of QTL conferring resistance to parasite infection and beetle fitness may result from the pleiotropic effects of the resistance genes on host fitness or from tight linkages between resistance genes and adverse deleterious mutations. Therefore, our results provide evidence that the genome regions conferring resistance to tapeworm infection are partially responsible for fitness costs in the resistant beetle populations.},

Pre-exposure, fasting, and postexposure mortality were low, sex ratio was equal, and fecundity of hosts was high during the first 30 wk, followed by increasing mortality and male bias of the sex ratio, and declining fecundity, in older beetles. These changes in the host were not associated with pronounced changes in infection results. Prevalence of infection was higher in females than males, but was unaffected by age in both sexes. Intensity of infection was similar between sexes in beetles up to 30 wk old, and thereafter declined in females, but not in males. Age-related changes in hosts were gradual, but unexpected levels of short-term variation in infection results suggest that some undetermined proximate factors may override general host age effects on the infection process.},

@article{Fialho2000,
abstract = {The bacteria in the genus Wolbachia are cytoplasmically inherited symbionts of arthropods. Infection often causes profound changes in host reproduction, enhancing bacterial transmission and spread in a population. The reproductive alterations known to result from Wolbachia infection include cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI), parthenogenesis, feminization of genetic males, fecundity enhancement, male killing and, perhaps, lethality Here, we report male killing in a third insect, the black flour beetle Tribolium madens, based on highly female-biased sex ratios of progeny from females infected with Wolbachia. The bias is cytoplasmic in nature as shown by repeated backcrossing of infected females with males of a naturally uninfected strain. Infection also lowers the egg hatch rates significantly to approximately half of those observed for uninfected females. Treatment of the host with antibiotics eliminated infection, reverted the sex ratio to unbiased levels and increased the percentage hatch. Typically Wolbachia infection is transmitted from mother to progeny, regardless of the sex of the progeny; however, infected T. madens males are never found. Virgin females are sterile, suggesting that the sex-ratio distortion in T. madens results from embryonic male killing rather than parthenogenesis. Based on DNA sequence data, the male-killing strain of Wolbachia in T. madens was indistinguishable from the CI-inducing Wolbachia in Tribolium confusum, a closely related beetle. Our findings suggest that host symbiont interaction effects may play an important role in the induction of Wolbachia reproductive phenotypes.},
