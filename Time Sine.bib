@article{Carothers1984,
abstract = {Theoretical and empirical work on time as a niche difference has been hindered by a narrow application of competition theory. While previous work has emphasized exploitation competition, we suggest that interference competition is much more likely to result in temporal partitioning. An advantage of this approach is that time becomes a truly independent niche axis: whereas exploitation competition pressumes partitioning of other niche axes (particularly food and habitat), interference competition allows time to become a dimension over which organisms may reduce the effects of agonistic interactions.},

@article{Menzel2008,
abstract = {A recent lengthening of the growing season in mid and higher latitudes of the northern hemisphere is reported as a clear indicator for climate change impacts. Using data from Germany (1951-2003) and Slovenia (1961-2004), we study whether changes in the start, end, and length of the growing season differ among four deciduous broad-leaved tree species and countries, how the changes are related to temperature changes, and what might be the confounding effects of an insect attack. The functional behaviour of the phenological and climatological time series and their trends are not analysed by linear regression, but by a new Bayesian approach taking into account different models for the functional description (one change-point, linear, constant models). We find advanced leaf unfolding in both countries with the same species order (oak {\textgreater} horse chestnut, beech, and birch). However, this advance is non linear over time and more apparent in Germany with clear change-points in the late 1970s, followed by marked advances (on average 3.67 days decade(-1) in the 2000s). In Slovenia, we find a more gradual advance of onset dates (on average 0.8 days decade(-1) in the 2000s). Leaf colouring of birch, beech, and oak has been slightly delayed in the last 3 decades, especially in Germany, however with no clear functional behaviour. Abrupt changes in leaf colouring dates of horse chestnut with recent advancing onset dates can be linked across countries to damage by a newly emerging pest, the horse chestnut leaf-miner (Cameraria ohridella). The lengthening of the growing season, more distinct in Germany than in Slovenia (on average 4.2 and 1.0 days decade(-1) in the 2000s, respectively), exhibits the same species order in both countries (oak {\textgreater} birch {\textgreater} beech). Damage by horse chestnut leaf-miner leads to reduced lengthening (Germany) and drastic shortening (Slovenia) of the horse chestnut growing season (-12 days decade(-1) in the 2000s). Advanced spring leaf unfolding and lengthening of the growing season of oak, beech and birch are highly significantly related to increasing March temperatures in both countries. Only beech and oak leaf unfolding in Germany, which is generally observed later in the year than that of the other two species, is more closely correlated with April temperatures, which comparably exhibit marked change-points at the end of the 1970s.},

abstract = {The magnetic compass of birds is embedded in the visual system and it has been hypothesized that the primary sensory mechanism is based on a radical pair reaction. Previous models of magnetoreception have assumed that the radical pair-forming molecules are rigidly fixed in space, and this assumption has been a major objection to the suggested hypothesis. In this article, we investigate theoretically how much disorder is permitted for the radical pair-forming, protein-based magnetic compass in the eye to remain functional. Our study shows that only one rotational degree of freedom of the radical pair-forming protein needs to be partially constrained, while the other two rotational degrees of freedom do not impact the magnetoreceptive properties of the protein. The result implies that any membrane-associated protein is sufficiently restricted in its motion to function as a radical pair-based magnetoreceptor. We relate our theoretical findings to the cryptochromes, currently considered the likeliest candidate to furnish radical pair-based magnetoreception.},

abstract = {We develop a method for describing the periodicity of noisy 'quasi-cyclic' time-series based on integrals of their power spectra corresponding to different frequency intervals that we use to classify time-series as 'strongly cyclic', 'weakly cyclic' or 'non-cyclic'. We apply this analysis to over 300 time-series of shooting records of red grouse from 289 moors located in 20 regions of the UK. Time-series from 63 of these populations were not distinguishable from white noise, but significant evidence of cyclic behaviour in the 2-15 year range was detected in time-series from 183 other populations. Time-series from the remaining 43 populations, though distinguishable from white noise, did not exhibit consistently recognizable cyclic behaviour in the same period range. Cyclic populations exhibit an average periodicity of 8.3 years, but only 20{\%} of these populations cycle with a period of four to six years. Geographically, grouse populations are remarkable more for their dynamic heterogeneity than for any observable regularity. The relationship between the location of populations and their dynamical behaviour is weak. The prevalence of cyclic time-series within a region did not significantly differ from the overall average value. Moor region explained 22{\%} of the variation in periodicity, differing from the overall mean in three regions. Average periodicity increases significantly from 6.8 to 8.9 years from the most southerly to most northerly populations. However, latitude explains only 5.3{\%} of the variation in periodicity of the cycles.},

@article{Budzynski2000,
abstract = {The ability of animals to learn to use the sun for orientation has been explored in numerous species. In birds, there is conflicting evidence about the experience needed for sun compass orientation to develop. The prevailing hypothesis is that birds need entire daytime exposure to the arc of the sun to use the sun as an orientation cue. However, there is also some evidence indicating that, even with limited exposure to the arc of the sun, birds, like insects, can use the sun to orient at any time of day. We re-examine this issue in a study of compass orientation in a cue-controlled arena. Two groups of young homing pigeons received different exposure to the sun. The control group experienced the sun throughout the day; the experimental group experienced only the apparent descent of the sun. After 8 weeks of sun exposure, we trained both groups in the afternoon to find food in a specific compass direction in an outdoor arena that provided a view of the sun but not landmarks. We then tested the pigeons in the morning for their ability to use the morning sun as an orientation cue. The control group and the experimental group, which was exposed to the morning sun for the first time, succeeded in orienting in the training direction during test 1. The orientation of the experimental group was no different from that of the control group, although the experimental first trial directional response latencies were greater than the control latencies. Subsequently, we continued training both groups in the afternoon and then tested the pigeons during the morning under complete cloud cover. Both groups displayed random directional responses under cloud cover, indicating that the observed orientation was based on the visibility of the sun. The data indicate that pigeons with limited exposure to the arc of the sun can, like insects, use the sun for orientation at any time of day.},

abstract = {There are several applications of combined phenological time series; e.g., trend analysis with long continuous time series, obtaining a compound and representative time series around weather stations for model fitting, data gap filling and outlier detection. Various methods to combine phenological time series have been proposed. We show that all of these methods can be analyzed within the theory of linear models. This has the advantage that the underlying assumptions for each model become transparent providing a theoretical basis for selecting a model for a particular situation. Moreover, the common theoretical background provides a means of comparing methods by Monte-Carlo simulation and with real data. Additionally, we explored the influences of two outlier detection methods. We show that the error called the month-mistake, whose origin is known and which is one of the few mistakes that can be detected in phenological data because of its large deviation, is best detected by the distribution-free 30-day residual rule in combination with a robust estimation procedure based on the minimization of the sum of absolute residuals (L1-norm).},

abstract = {Climate variability exists at all timescales-and climatic processes are intimately coupled, so that understanding variability at any one timescale requires some understanding of the whole. Records of the Earth's surface temperature illustrate this interdependence, having a continuum of variability following a power-law scaling. But although specific modes of interannual variability are relatively well understood, the general controls on continuum variability are uncertain and usually described as purely stochastic processes. Here we show that power-law relationships of surface temperature variability scale with annual and Milankovitch-period (23,000- and 41,000-year) cycles. The annual cycle corresponds to scaling at monthly to decadal periods, while millennial and longer periods are tied to the Milankovitch cycles. Thus the annual, Milankovitch and continuum temperature variability together represent the response to deterministic insolation forcing. The identification of a deterministic control on the continuum provides insight into the mechanisms governing interannual and longer-period climate variability.},

abstract = {Understanding the mechanisms that drive specialization and speciation within initially homogeneous populations is a fundamental challenge for evolutionary theory. It is an issue of relevance for significant open questions in biology concerning the generation and maintenance of biodiversity, the origins of reciprocal cooperation, and the efficient division of labor in social or colonial organisms. Several mathematical frameworks have been developed to address this question and models based on evolutionary game theory or the adaptive dynamics of phenotypic mutation have demonstrated the emergence of polymorphic, specialized populations. Here we focus on a ubiquitous biological phenomenon, migration. Individuals in our model may evolve the capacity to detect and follow an environmental cue that indicates a preferred migration route. The strategy space is defined by the level of investment in acquiring personal information about this route or the alternative tendency to follow the direction choice of others. The result is a relation between the migratory process and a game theoretic dynamic that is generally applicable to situations where information may be considered a public good. Through the use of an approximation of social interactions, we demonstrate the emergence of a stable, polymorphic population consisting of an uninformed subpopulation that is dependent upon a specialized group of leaders. The branching process is classified using the techniques of adaptive dynamics.},

abstract = {Johnson and Wehrly (1978, Journal of the American Statistical Association 73, 602-606) and Wehrly and Johnson (1980, Biometrika 67, 255-256) show one way to construct the joint distribution of a circular and a linear random variable, or the joint distribution of a pair of circular random variables from their marginal distributions and the density of a circular random variable, which in this article is referred to as joining circular density. To construct flexible models, it is necessary that the joining circular density be able to present multimodality and/or skewness in order to model different dependence patterns. Fern{\'{a}}ndez-Dur{\'{a}}n (2004, Biometrics 60, 499-503) constructed circular distributions based on nonnegative trigonometric sums that can present multimodality and/or skewness. Furthermore, they can be conveniently used as a model for circular-linear or circular-circular joint distributions. In the current work, joint distributions for circular-linear and circular-circular data constructed from circular distributions based on nonnegative trigonometric sums are presented and applied to two data sets, one for circular-linear data related to the air pollution patterns in Mexico City and the other for circular-circular data related to the pair of dihedral angles between consecutive amino acids in a protein.},

@article{Troein2009,
abstract = {The 24-hour rhythms of the circadian clock [1] allow an organism to anticipate daily environmental cycles, giving it a competitive advantage [2, 3]. Although clock components show little protein sequence homology across phyla, multiple feedback loops and light inputs are universal features of clock networks [4, 5]. Why have circadian systems evolved such a complex structure? All biological clocks entrain a set of regulatory genes to the environmental cycle, in order to correctly time the expression of many downstream processes. Thus the question becomes: What aspects of the environment, and of the desired downstream regulation, are demanding the observed complexity? To answer this, we have evolved gene regulatory networks in silico, selecting for networks that correctly predict particular phases of the day under light/dark cycles. Gradually increasing the realism of the environmental cycles, we have tested the networks for the minimal characteristics of clocks observed in nature: oscillation under constant conditions, entrainment to light signals, and the presence of multiple feedback loops and light inputs. Realistic circadian gene networks are found to require a nontrivial combination of conditions, with seasonal differences in photoperiod as a necessary but not sufficient component.},

abstract = {We use eddy covariance measurements of net ecosystem productivity (NEP) from 21 FLUXNET sites (153 site-years of data) to investigate relationships between phenology and productivity (in terms of both NEP and gross ecosystem photosynthesis, GEP) in temperate and boreal forests. Results are used to evaluate the plausibility of four different conceptual models. Phenological indicators were derived from the eddy covariance time series, and from remote sensing and models. We examine spatial patterns (across sites) and temporal patterns (across years); an important conclusion is that it is likely that neither of these accurately represents how productivity will respond to future phenological shifts resulting from ongoing climate change. In spring and autumn, increased GEP resulting from an 'extra' day tends to be offset by concurrent, but smaller, increases in ecosystem respiration, and thus the effect on NEP is still positive. Spring productivity anomalies appear to have carry-over effects that translate to productivity anomalies in the following autumn, but it is not clear that these result directly from phenological anomalies. Finally, the productivity of evergreen needleleaf forests is less sensitive to phenology than is productivity of deciduous broadleaf forests. This has implications for how climate change may drive shifts in competition within mixed-species stands.},

Phenology as a discipline observes these events and relates their annual variation to variation in climate. But phenology is also studied in other disciplines, each with their own perspective. Evolutionary ecologists study variation in seasonal timing and its fitness consequences, whereas chronobiologists emphasize the periodic nature of life-cycle stages and their underlying timing programmes (e.g. circannual rhythms). The (neuro-) endocrine processes underlying these life-cycle events are studied by physiologists and need to be linked to genes that are explored by molecular geneticists. In order to fully understand variation in phenology, we need to integrate these different perspectives, in particular by combining evolutionary and mechanistic approaches. We use avian research to characterize different perspectives and to highlight integration that has already been achieved. Building on this work, we outline a route towards uniting the different disciplines in a single framework, which may be used to better understand and, more importantly, to forecast climate change impacts on phenology.},
annote = {Intro







- some species show extreme reliability in year-to-year phenology (i.e. birds) while others show great variation between years. 
- temperate zone, temperature usually the best predictor of phenology.
- needed -- ability to predict phenology shifts well outside the current projected range of observed data to address climate change. Hence, we need a unified framework that incorporates an ecological and evolutionary prospective. 
- look up -- cirannual thythms.







Different Perspectives







-Phenologists -- record life-cycle events over long periods of time and relate the inter-annual variations to climatic variables.
- focus on seasonal recurrence in its own right.
- focus on first individuals or population mean rather than variation among individuals of the population.
- Individual approach -- The date that something happens is a phenotype and should be treated accordingly.
- variation in date will be the result of phenotypic plastisity and is this shaped by the interaction between the genotype and the environment.
- Evolutionary ecologist -- refer to it as "seasonal timing." Emphasize variation among individuals within years and between years. 
- "birds have been selected for their ability to have their chicks in the nest at the time of peak food abundance." -- I think the link to evolution is correct, but I don't think it has as much to do with food as it does with temperature. 
- have birds evoloved the ability to CORRECTLY interpret proximate cues (interpreted well before the actual breeding event) to hit a particular optimal date?
- cues should provide the ability to predict the future environment under which the phenotype will be selected. Including: conspecific and multi-trophic interactions. 
- these cues must actually be a suite of cues on a multi-dimensional enivronmental axis. 
- Mainly study organisms in the wild to observe fitness benifits and selection events on timing.
- Physiologists -- how do the changes within annual cycles causally come about? How can environmental cues adjust morphology, physiology, and behaviour over an annual schedule?
- strong emphasis on photoperiod. 
- hypothalamo-pituitary-honadal (HPG) axis is the well studied mechanism for translating photoperiod cues to behavioral action in birds.
- shown that temp, social, moisture, and food availability cues are also important, but the mechanism for translation is not as well known as the HPG axis.
- most of this work is done at the individual behavioral level, in a lab.
- test usually conducted under controlled temp (usually warmer than natural conditions and constant) with a heavy bias toward males rather than females (because females usually don't reach full reproductive maturity in captivity). 
- one useful proxy used in field experiments is gonadal development rather than actual egg laying. 
- Chronobiologist -- focus on internal timing programmes that enable organisms to cope with, and anticipate, geophysical cycles in the enivronment.
- this is the internal clock that persists even without external cues. 
-work on daily or yearly cycles
- seperate period (length of cycle) from phase (time when that cycle occurs). 
- less interested in variation between years or individuals 
- focus on avvual cycle and variation over the year.
- events occur based on the interplay between internal time-structuring and environmental cues. 
- seasonal clock determines how sensitive an animal is to external cues. The individual will respond to cues during some times of the year and not others. 
- for birds -- the circadian clock internally references 24 hours for the bird to compare the photoperiod to, to determine if a day is "long" (larger proportion of 24) or "short" (smaller proportion of 24). 
- If the bird is in the correct phase for photostimulation, a cascade of gene expression starts. 
- includes citations for comparisons of this process between different taxa. 
- Molecular Geneticist -- what are the genes controlling timing and how do those genes vary between individuals.
- have shown that a latitudinal gradient exists in the mean repeat lenght (more repeats at hight lats) exists in the one known candidate gene for timing. 
- females with shorter repeat lengths layed eggs earlier. 
- these studies completely absent in wild birds. 
- OTL studies are monitoring gene expression to try to find the genes controlling these cycles. Looking at both the genes that do the work and the genes that set that work into motion. 







Integration toward a single framework







- evolution is the primary controlling force. phenotype controlled by selection.
-relatively small changes in reproduction date have large fitness consequences. 
-because fitness consequences depend on a species' ecology, and the particular environment, "there is no single mechanism that fits all species."
-- I don't think this is exactly true... I'm trying to define the environment 
within with species or individual 
compete and set their date.
-a crucial step is taking account of variation between species or populations, as well as between individuals with a population. 
- 



















































animals must use cues to predict selection



















































. 
- so, the animal will use a cue that predicts indirect effects. i.e. precip -{\textgreater} grass -{\textgreater} food source.
- quails require a combined reduction in temperature and photoperiod to stop reproduction entirely. 
- the same temperature can have a stronger effect on a species during longer photoperiod than shorter photoperiod. 
- in very long photoperiods, individuals can breed under very low abient temperatures. 
- if things go wrong and you lay out of optimal zone or a severe weather event takes place, then individuals may switch to an emergency life-history stage. 
- phenotypic reaction norm -- a distribution where the breadth determines how broadly selection can act on a trait and the hight determines how strongly selection can act on a trait. 
- selection can not act on the translation and response to cues, not on date itself. probably also works on a suite of traits rather than a specific one.
-- similarities to spatial movement. 
We sense our location based on cues, 
not the location itself.
- the cues do not happen in the same environment as the reproduction. Again, prediction. 
- 














only if the environment of selection is predicted by an environmental variable can it serve as a predictive cue














. 








- Blue tit case study.








- Outlook -- where to go from here.
- climate change is effecting phenology, but how and why?
- If climate change affets the environmental variables that serve as cues differently from the from the environmental variables that form the environment at the time of selection, then the response to climate change will no longer be adaptive. Cues lose their predictive value. 
- for things to survive climate change, their phenotypic plasticity must be greater than the change in the environment.
- does learning play a role over the lifetime of individuals? probably...},

@article{Winder2010,
abstract = {Terrestrial plants are powerful climate sentinels because their annual cycles of growth, reproduction and senescence are finely tuned to the annual climate cycle having a period of one year. Consistency in the seasonal phasing of terrestrial plant activity provides a relatively low-noise background from which phenological shifts can be detected and attributed to climate change. Here, we ask whether phytoplankton biomass also fluctuates over a consistent annual cycle in lake, estuarine-coastal and ocean ecosystems and whether there is a characteristic phenology of phytoplankton as a consistent phase and amplitude of variability. We compiled 125 time series of phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll a concentration) from temperate and subtropical zones and used wavelet analysis to extract their dominant periods of variability and the recurrence strength at those periods. Fewer than half (48{\%}) of the series had a dominant 12-month period of variability, commonly expressed as the canonical spring-bloom pattern. About 20 per cent had a dominant six-month period of variability, commonly expressed as the spring and autumn or winter and summer blooms of temperate lakes and oceans. These annual patterns varied in recurrence strength across sites, and did not persist over the full series duration at some sites. About a third of the series had no component of variability at either the six- or 12-month period, reflecting a series of irregular pulses of biomass. These findings show that there is high variability of annual phytoplankton cycles across ecosystems, and that climate-driven annual cycles can be obscured by other drivers of population variability, including human disturbance, aperiodic weather events and strong trophic coupling between phytoplankton and their consumers. Regulation of phytoplankton biomass by multiple processes operating at multiple time scales adds complexity to the challenge of detecting climate-driven trends in aquatic ecosystems where the noise to signal ratio is high.},

Despite its widespread use, it relies on adjustable parameters that vary from region to region and suffers from known analytic inconsistencies. Here we introduce a stochastic process capturing local mobility decisions that helps us analytically derive commuting and mobility fluxes that require as input only information on the population distribution. The resulting radiation model predicts mobility patterns in good agreement with mobility and transport patterns observed in a wide range of phenomena, from long-term migration patterns to communication volume between different regions. Given its parameter-free nature, the model can be applied in areas where we lack previous mobility measurements, significantly improving the predictive accuracy of most of the phenomena affected by mobility and transport processes.},

@article{Clarke2006,
abstract = {In recent years, a number of species-energy hypotheses have been developed to explain global patterns in plant and animal diversity. These hypotheses frequently fail to distinguish between fundamentally different forms of energy which influence diversity in dissimilar ways. Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) can be utilized only by plants, though their abundance and growth rate is also greatly influenced by water. The Gibbs free energy (chemical energy) retained in the reduced organic compounds of tissue can be utilized by all heterotrophic organisms. Neither PAR nor chemical energy influences diversity directly. Both, however, influence biomass and/or abundance; diversity may then increase as a result of secondary population dynamic or evolutionary processes. Temperature is not a form of energy, though it is often used loosely by ecologists as a proxy for energy; it does, however, influence the rate of utilization of chemical energy by organisms. It may also influence diversity by allowing a greater range of energetic lifestyles at warmer temperatures (the metabolic niche hypothesis). We conclude that there is no single species/energy mechanism; fundamentally different processes link energy to abundance in plants and animals, and diversity is affected secondarily. If we are to make progress in elucidating these mechanisms, it is important to distinguish climatic effects on species' distribution and abundance from processes linking energy supply to plant and animal diversity.},
