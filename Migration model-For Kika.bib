@article{Huey2009,
abstract = {Biological impacts of climate warming are predicted to increase with latitude, paralleling increases in warming. However, the magnitude of impacts depends not only on the degree of warming but also on the number of species at risk, their physiological sensitivity to warming and their options for behavioural and physiological compensation. Lizards are useful for evaluating risks of warming because their thermal biology is well studied. We conducted macrophysiological analyses of diurnal lizards from diverse latitudes plus focal species analyses of Puerto Rican Anolis and Sphaerodactyus. Although tropical lowland lizards live in environments that are warm all year, macrophysiological analyses indicate that some tropical lineages (thermoconformers that live in forests) are active at low body temperature and are intolerant of warm temperatures. Focal species analyses show that some tropical forest lizards were already experiencing stressful body temperatures in summer when studied several decades ago. Simulations suggest that warming will not only further depress their physiological performance in summer, but will also enable warm-adapted, open-habitat competitors and predators to invade forests. Forest lizards are key components of tropical ecosystems, but appear vulnerable to the cascading physiological and ecological effects of climate warming, even though rates of tropical warming may be relatively low.},

@article{Hertz1992a,
abstract = {The field thermal biology of sympatric Anolis cooki and A. eristateIlus were evaluated in January and in August in desert scrub forest at Playa de Tamarindo near Guanica, Puerto Rico. Data on randomly posi- tioned copper models of lizards, each equipped with a built-in thermocouple, established null hypotheses about basking frequency and operative temperatures (T{\~{}}) against which the behavior and body temperatures (Tb) of live lizards were evaluated. Both species exhibited non-random hourly basking rates (more marked in cris- tatellus than in cooki), and cristatellus was virtually inac- tive during the warm mid-day hours. The relationship between lizards' T b and randomly sampled T{\~{}} differed between the species: eristatellus's mean Tb was 2 {\~{}} to 3 {\~{}} C lower than randomly sampled mean To in both months, whereas cooki's mean Tb was slightly higher than mean T{\~{}} in January and slightly lower in August. Although cooki's mean T b was higher than that of cristatellus in both months, the Tb'S of the two species overlapped substantially over an annual cycle. Given the similarities in their field active T b and the low thermal heterogeneity among microsites at Playa de Tamarindo, these species appear not to partition the thermal environment there in a coarse-grained way. Instead, the relatively small dif- ferences in their field active T b probably result from small differences in their use of similar microhabitats within their mutually exclusive territories. Thermal resource partitioning by territorial animals is unlikely unless ther- mal heterogeneity is coarse-grained in relation to territo- ry size},
