abstract = {Rao has developed quadratic entropy to measure diversity in a set of entities divided up among a fixed set of categories. This index depends on a chosen matrix of dissimilarities among categories and a frequency distribution of these categories. With certain choices of dissimilarities, this index could be maximized over all frequency distributions by eliminating several categories. This unexpected result is radically opposite to those obtained with usual diversity indices. We demonstrate that the elimination of categories to maximize the quadratic entropy depends on mathematical properties of the chosen dissimilarities. In particular, when quadratic entropy is applied to ultrametric dissimilarities, all categories are retained in order to reach its maximal value. Three examples, varying from simple one-dimensional to ultrametric dissimilarity matrices, are provided. We conclude that, as far as diversity measurement is concerned, quadratic entropy is most relevant when applied to ultrametric dissimilarities},

abstract = {As better phylogenetic hypotheses become available for many groups of organisms, studies in community ecology can be informed by knowledge of the evolutionary relationships among coexisting species. We note three primary approaches to integrating phylogenetic information into studies of community organization: 1. examining the phylogenetic structure of community assemblages, 2. exploring the phylogenetic basis of community niche structure, and 3. adding a community context to studies of trait evolution and biogeography. We recognize a common pattern of phylogenetic conservatism in ecological character and highlight the challenges of using phylogenies of partial lineages. We also review phylogenetic approaches to three emergent properties of communities: species diversity, relative abundance distributions, and range sizes. Methodological advances in phylogenetic supertree construction, character reconstruction, null models for community assembly and character evolution, and metrics of community phylogenetic structure underlie the recent progress in these areas. We highlight the potential for community ecologists to benefit from phylogenetic knowledge and suggest several avenues for future research.},

abstract = {Phylogenies reconstructed from gene sequences can be used to investigate the tempo and mode of species diversification. Here we develop and use new statistical methods to infer past patterns of speciation and extinction from molecular phylogenies. Specifically, we test the null hypothesis that per-lineage speciation and extinction rates have remained constant through time. Rejection of this hypothesis may provide evidence for evolutionary events such as adaptive radiations or key adaptations. In contrast to previous approaches, our methods are robust to incomplete taxon sampling and are conservative with respect to extinction. Using simulation we investigate, first, the adverse effects of failing to take incomplete sampling into account and, second, the power and reliability of our tests. When applied to published phylogenies our tests suggest that, in some cases, speciation rates have decreased through time.},

abstract = {Tropical mountains are hotspots of biodiversity, but the factors that generate this high diversity remain poorly understood. To identify possible mechanisms that influence avian species assemblages in the tropical Andes, we studied the functional and phylogenetic diversity and the structure of species assemblages of an avian feeding guild. We analysed how functional and phylogenetic diversity, structure and composition of frugivorous bird assemblages changed along a 3300 m elevational transect from the lowlands to the tree line with a novel combination of functional and phylogenetic approaches, and used null models to infer possible drivers of the observed patterns. Species richness, functional richness and phylogenetic diversity decreased almost monotonically with increasing elevation, but assemblage structure and composition changed abruptly in the Andean foothills at around 1200 m. In the lowland assemblages, species were functionally and phylogenetically less similar than expected from null models, whereas species in the highland assemblages were functionally and phylogenetically more similar than expected by chance, suggesting an abrupt reduction in the number of functionally and phylogenetically distinct species in the transition from lowlands to the highlands. Nevertheless, the functional and phylogenetic evenness of the assemblages, i.e. the regularity of the spacing of species in functional trait space and phylogeny, remained constant along the gradient, which suggests that the mechanisms that influence the co-occurrence of species within the assemblages are similar in lowlands and highlands. The observed differences between lowland and highland assemblages imply sharp distributional limits for frugivorous bird species in the Andean foothills, probably caused by environmental factors other than climate, e.g. changes in habitat types or topography, or independent species radiations in lowlands and highlands. These strong distributional limits may hinder uphill range shifts of frugivorous bird species, and the plant species they disperse, in the tropical Andes as a response to climate change.},

@article{Safi2013a,
abstract = {Background Conservation of phylogenetic diversity allows maximising evolutionary information preserved within fauna and flora. The “EDGE of Existence” programme is the first institutional conservation initiative that prioritises species based on phylogenetic information. Species are ranked in two ways: one according to their evolutionary distinctiveness (ED) and second, by including IUCN extinction status, their evolutionary distinctiveness and global endangerment (EDGE). Here, we describe the global patterns in the spatial distribution of priority ED and EDGE species, in order to identify conservation areas for mammalian and amphibian communities. In addition, we investigate whether environmental conditions can predict the observed spatial pattern in ED and EDGE globally. Methods and Principal Findings Priority zones with high concentrations of ED and EDGE scores were defined using two different methods. The overlap between mammal and amphibian zones was very small, reflecting the different phylo-biogeographic histories. Mammal ED zones were predominantly found on the African continent and the neotropical forests, whereas in amphibians, ED zones were concentrated in North America. Mammal EDGE zones were mainly in South-East Asia, southern Africa and Madagascar; for amphibians they were in central and south America. The spatial pattern of ED and EDGE was poorly described by a suite of environmental variables. Conclusions Mapping the spatial distribution of ED and EDGE provides an important step towards identifying priority areas for the conservation of mammalian and amphibian phylogenetic diversity in the EDGE of existence programme.},

abstract = {Conservation priority setting based on phylogenetic diversity has frequently been proposed but rarely implemented. Here, we define a simple index that measures the contribution made by different species to phylogenetic diversity and show how the index might contribute towards species-based conservation priorities. We describe procedures to control for missing species, incomplete phylogenetic resolution and uncertainty in node ages that make it possible to apply the method in poorly known clades. We also show that the index is independent of clade size in phylogenies of more than 100 species, indicating that scores from unrelated taxonomic groups are likely to be comparable. Similar scores are returned under two different species concepts, suggesting that the index is robust to taxonomic changes. The approach is applied to a near-complete species-level phylogeny of the Mammalia to generate a global priority list incorporating both phylogenetic diversity and extinction risk. The 100 highest-ranking species represent a high proportion of total mammalian diversity and include many species not usually recognised as conservation priorities. Many species that are both evolutionarily distinct and globally endangered (EDGE species) do not benefit from existing conservation projects or protected areas. The results suggest that global conservation priorities may have to be reassessed in order to prevent a disproportionately large amount of mammalian evolutionary history becoming extinct in the near future.},

abstract = {1 Analysing the phylogenetic structure of natural communities may illuminate theprocesses governing the assembly and coexistence of species in ecological communities. 2 Unifying previous works, we present a statistical framework to quantify thephylogenetic structure of communities in terms of average divergence time betweenpairs of individuals or species, sampled from different sites. This framework allows anadditive partitioning of the phylogenetic signal into alpha (within-site) and beta(among-site) components, and is closely linked to Simpson diversity. It unifies thetreatment of intraspecific (genetic) and interspecific diversity, leading to the definitionof differentiation coefficients among community samples (e.g. I ST , P ST ) analogous toclassical population genetics coefficients expressing differentiation among populations(e.g. F ST , N ST ). 3 Two coefficients which express community differentiation among sites from speciesidentity ( I ST ) or species phylogeny ( P ST ) require abundance data (number of individualsper species per site), and estimators that are unbiased with respect to sample size aregiven. Another coefficient ( $\Pi$ ST ) expresses the gain of the mean phylogenetic distancebetween species found in different sites compared with species found within sites, andrequires only incidence data (presence/absence of each species in each site). 4 We present tests based on phylogenetic tree randomizations to detect communityphylogenetic clustering ( P ST {\textgreater} I ST or $\Pi$ ST {\textgreater} 0) or phylogenetic overdispersion ( P ST {\textless} I ST or $\Pi$ ST {\textless} 0). In addition, we propose a novel approach to detect phylogenetic clusteringor overdispersion in different clades or at different evolutionary time depths usingpartial randomizations. 5 I ST , P ST or $\Pi$ ST can also be used as distances between community samples andregressed on ecological or geographical distances, allowing us to investigate the factorsresponsible for the phylogenetic signal and the critical scales at which it appears. 6 We illustrate the approach on forest tree communities in Equatorial Guinea,where a phylogenetic clustering signal was probably due to phylogenetically conservedadaptations to the elevation gradient and was mostly contributed to by ancient cladesubdivisions. 7 The approach presented should find applications for comparing quantitativelyphylogenetic patterns of different communities, of similar communities in different regionsor continents, or of populations (within species) vs. communities (among species).},

abstract = {Functional diversity is increasingly identiﬁed as an importa nt driver ofecosystem functioning. Various indices have been proposed to measure the functionaldiversity of a community, but there is still no consensus on which are most suitable. Indeed,none of the existing indices meets all the criteria required for general use. The main criteria arethat they must be designed to deal with several traits, take into account abundances, andmeasure all the facets of functional diversity. Here we propose three indices to quantify eachfacet of functional diversity for a community with species distributed in a multidimensionalfunctional space: functional richness (volume of the functional space occupied by thecommunity), functional evenness (regularity of the distribution of abundance in this volume),and functional divergence (divergence in the distribution of abundance in this volume).Functional richness is estimated using the existing convex hull volume index. The newfunctional evenness index is based on the minimum spanning tree which links all the species inthe multidimensional functional space. Then this new index quantiﬁes the regularity withwhich species abundances are distributed along the spanning tree. Functional divergence ismeasured using a novel index which quantiﬁes how species diverge in their distances (weightedby their abundance) from the center of gravity in the functional space. We show that none ofthe indices meets all the criteria required for a functional diversity index, but instead we showthat the set of three complementary indices meets these criteria. Through simulations ofartiﬁcial data sets, we demonstrate that functional divergence and functional evenness areindependent of species richness and that the three functional diversity indices are independentof each other. Overall, our study suggests that decomposition of functional diversity into itsthree primary components provides a meaningful framework for its quantiﬁcation and for theclassiﬁcation of existing functional diversity indices. This decomposition has the potential toshed light on the role of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning and on the inﬂuence of bioticand abiotic ﬁlters on the structure of species communities. Finally, we propose a generalframework for applying these three functional diversity indices.},

abstract = {The use of phylogenies in ecology is increasingly common and has broadened our understanding of biological diversity. Ecological sub-disciplines, particularly conservation, community ecology and macroecology, all recognize the value of evolutionary relationships but the resulting development of phylogenetic approaches has led to a proliferation of phylogenetic diversity metrics. The use of many metrics across the sub-disciplines hampers potential meta-analyses, syntheses, and generalizations of existing results. Further, there is no guide for selecting the appropriate metric for a given question, and different metrics are frequently used to address similar questions. To improve the choice, application, and interpretation of phylo-diversity metrics, we organize existing metrics by expanding on a unifying framework for phylogenetic information. Generally, questions about phylogenetic relationships within or between assemblages tend to ask three types of question: how much; how different; or how regular? We show that these questions reflect three dimensions of a phylogenetic tree: richness, divergence, and regularity. We classify 70 existing phylo-diversity metrics based on their mathematical form within these three dimensions and identify 'anchor' representatives: for $\alpha$-diversity metrics these are PD (Faith's phylogenetic diversity), MPD (mean pairwise distance), and VPD (variation of pairwise distances). By analysing mathematical formulae and using simulations, we use this framework to identify metrics that mix dimensions, and we provide a guide to choosing and using the most appropriate metrics. We show that metric choice requires connecting the research question with the correct dimension of the framework and that there are logical approaches to selecting and interpreting metrics. The guide outlined herein will help researchers navigate the current jungle of indices.},

abstract = {In multivariate analyses of the e ects of both natural and anthropogenic environmental variability on community composition, many species are interchange- able in the way that they characterise the samples, giving rise to the concept of structural redundancy in com- munity composition. Here, we develop a method of quantifying the extent of this redundancy by extracting a series of subsets of species, the multivariate response pattern of each of which closely matches that for the whole community. Structural redundancy is then re- ̄ected in the number of such subsets, which we term ``response units'', that can be extracted without re- placement. We have applied this technique to the e ects of the Amoco-Cadiz oil-spill on marine macrobenthos in the Bay of Morlaix, France, and to the natural inter- annual variability of macrobenthos at two stations o the coast of Northumberland, England. Structural redundancy is shown to be remarkably high, with the number and sizes of subsets being comparable in all three examples. Taxonomic/functional groupings of species within the di ering response units change in abundance in the same way over time. The response units are shown to possess a wide taxonomic spread and, using two di erent types of randomisation test, dem- onstrated to have a taxonomically and functionally co- herent structure. The level of structural redundancy may therefore be an indirect measure of the resilience or compensation potential within an assemblage.},

abstract = {The practice of environmental planning and protection frequently necessitates the quantification of ecological diversity. Traditional ‘ecological diversity indices' are based on the abundances of species present. However, such indices are insensitive to taxonomic or similar differences. With equal species abundances they measure the species richness (species number) only. Conversely, so-called ‘biodiversity indices' are based on species differences, but are insensitive to the abundance conditions. The quadratic entropy index is the only ecological diversity index, the value of which reflects both the differences ‘and' abundances of the species. When a species list is given without abundance data, then, using the quadratic entropy index and postulating equal abundances, one gets the only biodiversity index derived from a traditional ecological index of diversity. Its extensive form is identical with the sum of differences or distances between the species present. This index trivially satisfies set monotonicity, an important property for biodiversity indices.},

abstract = {A further biodiversity index is proposed, based on taxonomic (or phylogenetic) related- ness of species, namely the ‘variation in taxonomic distinctness' (VarTD, $\Lambda$+) between every pair of species recorded in a study. It complements the previously defined ‘average taxonomic distinctness' (AvTD, ∆+), which is the mean path length through the taxonomic tree connecting every pair of spe- cies in the list. VarTD is simply the variance of these pairwise path lengths and reflects the uneven- ness of the taxonomic tree. For example, a species list in which there are several different orders rep- resented only by a single species, but also some genera which are very species-rich, would give a high $\Lambda$+ by comparison with a list (of equivalent ∆+) in which all species tended to be from different families but the same order. VarTD is shown to have the same desirable sampling properties as AvTD, primarily a lack of dependence of its mean value on the sample size (except for unrealistically small samples). Such unbiasedness is of crucial importance in making valid biodiversity comparisons between studies at different locations or times, with differing or uncontrolled degrees of sampling effort. This feature is emphatically not shared by indices related to species richness and also not by properties of the phylogeny adapted from proposals in other, conservation contexts, such as ‘average phylogenetic diversity' (AvPD, $\Phi$+). As with AvTD, the VarTD statistic for any local study can be tested for ‘departure from expectation', based on a master taxonomy for that region, by constructing a simulation distribution from random subsets of the master list. The idea can be extended to sum- marising the joint distribution of AvTD and VarTD, so that values from real data sets are compared with a fitted simulation ‘envelope' in a 2 d (∆+, $\Lambda$+) plot. The methodology is applied to 14 species lists of free-living marine nematodes, and related to a master list for UK waters. The combination of AvTD and VarTD picks out, in different ways, some degraded locations (low ∆+, low to normal $\Lambda$+) and the pristine island fauna of the Scillies (normal ∆+, high $\Lambda$+). The 2 indices are also demonstrated to be measuring effectively independent features of the taxonomic tree, at least for this faunal group (al- though it is shown theoretically that this will not always be the case). The combination of ∆+ and $\Lambda$+ is therefore seen to provide a statistically robust summary of taxonomic (or phylogenetic) relatedness patterns within an assemblage, which has the potential to be applied to a wide range of historical data in the form of simple species lists.},

abstract = {We present a new, broadly applicable measure of the spatial restriction of phylogenetic diversity, termed phylogenetic endemism (PE). PE combines the widely used phylogenetic diversity and weighted endemism measures to identify areas where substantial components of phylogenetic diversity are restricted. Such areas are likely to be of considerable importance for conservation. PE has a number of desirable properties not combined in previous approaches. It assesses endemism consistently, independent of taxonomic status or level, and independent of previously defined political or biological regions. The results can be directly compared between areas because they are based on equivalent spatial units. PE builds on previous phylogenetic analyses of endemism, but provides a more general solution for mapping endemism of lineages. We illustrate the broad applicability of PE using examples of Australian organisms having contrasting life histories: pea-flowered shrubs of the genus Daviesia (Fabaceae) and the Australian species of the Australo-Papuan tree frog radiation within the family Hylidae.},

@article{Barker2002,
abstract = {The value of biodiversity lies in its option value for the future, the greater the complement of contemporary biodi- versity conserved today, the greater the possibilities for future biodiversity because of the diverse genetic resource needed to ensure continued evolution in a changing and uncertain world. From this perspective, biodiversity option value can be equated with richness in the different features expressed by species. An individual species of greater value is one contributing more novel features to a given subset. The feature diversity of species and communities is difficult to estimate directly, but can be predicted by the phylogenetic relationships among the species. The ‘Phy- logenetic Diversity' measure (PD) (Faith, 1992a) estimates the relative feature diversity of any nominated set of species by the sum of the lengths of all those branches spanned by the set. These branch lengths reflect patristic or path-length distances. This study first reviews and expands on some of the properties of PD, and develops simple modifications of the measure (DnPD and enPD) to enable capture of both the phylogenetic relatedness of species and their abundances in each sample. Then the application of PD, DnPD and enPD to a wide range of conservation and resource management issues is demonstrated using avian case studies. Supertree construction procedures (matrix representation using parsimony analysis; average consensus) were used to combine the extensive DNA–DNA hybridization tree of Sibley {\&} Ahlquist (1990) with numerous, recently published phylogenetic recon- structions to derive a phylogenetic tree for the global avian fauna. Using this supertree as a systematic framework, the utility of PD was demonstrated in four case studies: (i) state of the environment reporting, with changes in avian faunas resulting from extinctions quantified as indicators of the state of biodiversity at Global, New Zealand and Waikato region scales, and changes in available habitat quantified as indicators of pressures on biodiversity in the Waikato region; (ii) setting priorities for threatened species management, with PD as a measure of option value integrated with information on survivorship expectations to develop a ranking among threatened New Zealand forest bird species; (iii) monitoring biotic response to management, with data from 5-minute counts used to analyse changes in forest bird communities under three management regimes in New Zealand; and (iv) selection of indica- tor species, with PD used to objectively identify subsets of species in the Global, New Zealand and Waikato avian faunas that comprise a high proportion of the option value in those faunas.},
